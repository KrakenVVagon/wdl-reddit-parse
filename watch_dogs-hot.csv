WDL Launch Spoiler Policy / Content Removal Update,104,jjr3zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jjr3zr/wdl_launch_spoiler_policy_content_removal_update/,25,1603931614.0,vanade,"###Welcome 

Hello DedSec members! We’re on the eve of Watch Dogs: Legion’s global launch and [many regions have now begun to unlock the game](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/watch-dogs/legion/news-updates/30fdWwcvWlw3fBc3hKJXjy/everything-you-need-to-know-about-watch-dogs-legions-launch), so it’s high time for us to reiterate some important rules. 

Firstly we’d like to welcome /u/Treviso to the mod team, who joins us both on the subreddit and discord. You may recognize him as the organizer of the recent WD Marathon. Please give him a warm welcome :)

**Mod Team**:

###SPOILER POLICY

Credit to /r/assassinscreed for the following spoiler writeup (we have made slight changes):

* If your post contains any spoilers always use [Spoiler] in the title, BUT DO NOT SPOIL ANYTHING IN THE TITLE ITSELF.
* You must spoiler-tag your posts and comments appropriately or they will be removed.
* Initially any untagged posts and comments spoiling WD Legion will be met with a 2-week ban. Troll accounts will be banned permanently.
* If the post already has [Spoiler] in its title, you do not need to hide any spoiler comments, as long as they are within the scope of the same topic.
* If you come across any untagged spoilers, report and downvote them. We will try to remove them as quickly as possible.

##Hiding Spoilers:

In comments and self-posts, using ```>!Spoilers Go Here!<``` will render the text illegible unless hovered/clicked. Example: >!Watch Dogs: Legion!<

##What Counts as a Spoiler?


Definition of a Spoiler: Revealing information that could ruin others' enjoyment of a game they haven't yet played. This includes revealing major elements of the plot or significant story-line events.

*Story events

*Side quest/easter egg content 

___
###Updated Removal Rules:

The following posts will be removed to prevent low-quality spam on the subreddit. Of course, posts can also still be removed at mod discretion if they break any of the other rules listed on the sub. 

* posting that you got your copy of the game 
* “can I run this on my PC”
* decide for me posts: (should I buy this game, should I get it on PS4 or PS5, which edition should I get etc)
* questions that you can easily google the answer to (“when is MP coming out” etc)
* pity posts (“I can’t get legion until x date but here’s a meme for you guys”)
* support-related questions: we will likely create 1 catch-all megathread for these/known issues, but please [submit a support ticket](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US) to ubisoft. Individual threads will be removed.

___
###Photo Posts

For now, to be extra vigilant re: spoilers since our bot cannot scan images, we will be turning on manual approval for any photo posts. This will be removed once things quiet down a bit, but for now it allows us to manage potential image spoilers more easily. 

___
###Feedback

We are happy to hear any feedback you might have or suggestions to improve the subreddit. Please be patient with our mod team in these coming weeks; we're doing our best to keep things civil and spoiler-free for everyone's enjoyment, but we are also moderating the [official watchdogs discord](http://discord.gg/watchdogs) at the same time AND trying to play the game :)",Text,2020-10-28 20:33:34

The police (like actual Met Police) are done really well in this game. Some minor additions would go a long way though.,130,jm7tip,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jm7tip/the_police_like_actual_met_police_are_done_really/,44,1604286158.0,rifledude,"This game has done police better than any other game that I've played. I'm not kidding. The way that the pedestrians interact with the police characters, their equipment, [and their uniform variations are actually incredible](https://imgur.com/a/Oofhgz6).

Was walking around liberated Camden with an officer, and was really surprised to have a bunch of pedestrians react really positively to the character. Even in games where you play as a cop like in Sleeping Dogs or True Crime, never have I seen pedestrians react to an officer like in this game. Criminals will get aggressive (""fuck off pig"") to you, and Albion personnel seem to have this tension with a cop around.

I hope Ubi makes some minor additions though to really bring them next level. First, the Met need some actual police cars. It's very clear in game that the Met and Albion are independent organizations with their own command structures. Even if Albion has supplanted the role of the Met in most areas, they are still part of the law enforcement system. If Ubi can add a smaller chance that the Albion patrol cars around stations could spawn as a Met car, I think it would go a long way in making it feel as though they are unique agencies.

A simple retexture of the police car and SUV and swapping the red lights for blue would be sufficient. Having both marked police vehicles, and black traffic vehicles would be even better. While on the topic of police cars, why don't the emergency lights stay on when you get out of the car? This is definitely a minor detail, but I think its annoying how the lights turn off but the radio keeps playing.

I think it would be a great addition to include some firearm officers as a type of officer that can spawn. It would be nice to have some officers with a pistol+taser combo, or an officer with an MP5. I hope they add a police tactical unit too, a SWAT-type officer that would be armed with a G36. I think it would be an interesting alternative to the other assault rifle NPCs in the various factions. Lastly, having the detectives have a chance to have a pistol would be really good too.",Text,2020-11-01 22:02:38

You can try how you want, but this will happen unless you manually don’t create every single character. Which is not possible.

Personally? I rather have it like this, than another “normal game”. If I find two same looking/sounding characters I will get rid of one. Simple solution.

That’s just advantage and disadvantage of system like this. Same thing happen in every similar game. Like XCom, SoD etc.

Right now every Tom, Dick and Harry can spot you right away if you're close enough. It'd be nice to work harder to get a Captain then only have to worry about other Captains or special enemies that can see through the disguise.

I know they say in the first Uniformed Access official mission that ""maybe some of your cohorts won't realise you've left yet"" or whatever Bagley says but how many regular goons do you think are gonna question a Captain?

As a huge Watch Dogs fan I really wanted another game after Watch Dogs 2 which was so much fun to play with in my opinion.

So I have played it and here is what I have to say. Watch Dogs Legion is a good game but that fails with its main premise. 

Watch Dogs Legion plays really fun and the hacking, shooting and driving are still very fun. London is an amazing setting. The problem is the whole recruitment thing. When I first started the game I was blown away about all the people I could recruit and their biographies and abilities.

But after a few hours you realize this idea only hurts the game. While the characters do have their differences it doesn’t affect much in gameplay and you could complete the game with a homeless guy the same way you could with a hit man.

The story has potential but by you playing with random characters who just jump in the middle of the story like if they were there from the start ruins the experience and the voices and lip syncing is genuinely horrible. You don’t have a connection with these people the same way you had with Marcus and Aiden. 

In conclusion the game is fun and I think it will be even better when online releases and there is less bugs but the whole concept of making your own legion while being interesting it was way too ambitious and lacked thought in a few aspects.",Text,2020-11-02 03:37:10

Feeling Conflicted,14,jmayml,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jmayml/feeling_conflicted/,12,1604296635.0,gavinfarrell,"I’ve spent about 10-15 hours or so with the game at this point, almost done all the uprisings in the regions. 

On one hand, I really don’t think this game is really any good at all. They’ve stripped back a LOT of features, some of which have reduced the gameplay quality pretty significantly, it’s clunky, the story isn’t interesting, almost to the point where it’s nearly irrelevant and often boring, all in favour of a gameplay loop using a system that regularly defeats its own purpose and gives you very little incentive to actually use it once you’ve liberated the first area, because you get a hacker and a construction worker. The lip syncing is god awful, the modulated voices are extremely off putting, the Irish gangster theme is absolutely cringeworthy (from the perspective of an Irish person. I mean, calling your gang a clan?), often times the tone is all over the place not knowing whether it’s supposed to be serious or comedy, which was a problem the whole way through the marketing campaign. It’s regularly a disaster and a bug ridden mess, poorly optimised, visually unimpressive and load times take forever. A game about the convenience of technology, where it’s own technology is massively inconvenient (looking at you audio diaries)

With all that being said, I just can’t put the damn thing down. It’s inexplicably compelling. I’m having a lot of fun, despite the honestly glaring flaws that this game has. I find myself losing track of time when I get the chance to play, trying to squeeze an extra few minutes on, jumping in when I get any 15 minute window. Mindlessly strolling around for a peek into the lives of the randoms pottering around London, collecting things, getting my team into outfits that properly accentuate their skills, roles and personality, helping out their friends, hunting their enemies. All in all, I’m pretty sure I’m enjoying it, and I’m excited to see how it plays out. 

I just hope that a lot of the issues can be fixed in patches, and quality of life can be improved, because there’s a lot of potential here. I want to enjoy it as much as I can.

TL;DR - Bad game, good fun.",Text,2020-11-02 00:57:15

Leave any you might have in the comments!

&#x200B;

1. You can use Parcel Fox drones to pick up the blue boxes which contain masks in them. This can be done in the same manner a cargo drone picks up large cargo (by almost landing on it).
2. You can essentially skip recruitment missions by doing Deep Profiling objectives. This can be a lot less time-consuming. Typically it just takes one for them to be recruited, unless they dislike DedSec (one thumbs down), in which case it'll be two objectives.
3. Although when you select “retire operative” it claims to be permanent, if you’re lucky enough to encounter them in game once more, you can recruit them at no expense.",Text,2020-11-01 14:51:53
The biggest oversight for console players,26,jm6a8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jm6a8f/the_biggest_oversight_for_console_players/,6,1604281030.0,Dolenzz,"I am still on my initial play through, trying to be true to the nature of deadsec and playing as non-lethally as possible and I have recruited some operatives that I like to use.

But even as I play I find myself wondering about doing other play throughs. Maybe I want to try PermaDeath. Maybe I want a crew of old, low mobility operatives. Maybe I want to try an all lethal squad who ignores the tech tree for the most part.

Now from what I see and have read here, I can try any or all of those options if I am willing to wipe out my save, and thereby my main crew. Um, no thanks. I want my current crew to stick around for any DLC. I don't want to have to jump through hoops to backup save files or create new PS4 profiles to save my main cast of operatives.

So in the end what the single save slot does is deter some of us from continuing to play the game after we finish it the first time. This isn't like WD1 where I always play Aiden or WD2 where I always play Marcus. The recruit anyone mechanic encourages multiple play throughs with different team make ups.

"WD3 is a good bet for those looking for Skyrim/MnB/CK3 type of immersive, emergent, and RP experience. It may be different for those looking for Ghost of Tsushima or Assassin's Creed battle+stealth experience",4,jmf7dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jmf7dj/wd3_is_a_good_bet_for_those_looking_for/,1,1604312500.0,noobakosowhat,"I'm in love with this game, but in a different way from how I feel as to GoT or other AC games for that matter. WD3 really nails the open world RP feel. I've been experiencing a lot of restartitis--but in a good way.

When I first played WD3, I approached it like how I approached WD3, AC, and GoT--get which is the most stealthiest way to finish missions. However when I started using other operatives, that's when it clicked--I can play this game in character! 

I immediately restarted and made some choices--I recruited an Albion officer, a Clan Kelly officer, a hacker, and a transient with silenced gun + stealth steps.

However as I was playing the game again I noticed I was making gameplay choices and approaching the game still with not much character as I wanted. So I tried two to three missions in character, and boy was some of then became so chaotic... And fun. Heck my transient died but I was able to recruit a hitman and a spy in her replacement (the spy's deep profiling revealed a competitor spy, which I chose to recruit). 

 Discovering the fun in RPing the game, I decided to restart again, for a third time.

The game isn't as hard even with permadeath on, as it shares the same difficulty as that of Skyrim's. It's perfect for those who want to RP and play the game with a mix of being methodical and being spontaneous.

I think this is a huge stepping stone for Ubisoft in terms of game design, opening them up for huge opportunities for future games.",Text,2020-11-02 05:21:40

All the Albion Archetypes,4,jme6gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jme6gv/all_the_albion_archetypes/,3,1604308449.0,ordinarymartian,"I thought I should share this here so people can know who is who and what is what. If there's any arch type I missed please let me know in the comments.

&#x200B;

**Albion Employee**

Albion employees have two different variations. You'll commonly see them on the streets, they aren't armed with guns and usually don't respond If you incite violence, unlike most Albion. Albion employees usually have a black bomber jacket with the Albion logo on it or a black suit with a black and yellow striped tie with an Albion armband over it. These people are usually at recruitment stations.

&#x200B;

**Albion Guard**

Albion guards are the lowest and least powerful of the hierarchy (not counting employees). Albion Guards usually wear all black with a vest and have a beret and are usually armed with a pistol and when engaged in melee combat usually have a baton. Albion Guards are usually found inside interiors as regular security.

&#x200B;

**Albion Soldier**

Albion Soldier's as I like to call them are equipped with a yellow vest, yellow camouflage pants, and a long-sleeve yellow shirt and glasses with an Albion hat and headphones. Albion Soldiers are equipped with an assault rifle or LMG, baton which will be used in melee combat and can arrest people. These soldiers are more lethal than Albion Guards and are often seen in the middle of streets or guarding a building or an area. Albion Soldiers are the ones harassing and beating innocent people out of the most.

&#x200B;

**Albion Captain**

These guys are more intense than regular Albion Soldiers. Albion Captains bare the same yellow as the Soldiers do, however they wear black armor over it and have a black military helmet and tend to or seem to be larger than most Albion. Albion Captains take more damage and are equipped with a powerful assault rifle or LMG.  Albion Captains were the Albion soldiers displayed in the many trailers pre-release. They usually look like they are wearing virtual reality.

&#x200B;

**White Soldiers?**

I don't know what their names are as usually all of these people are normally just named ""Contractors"", but usually they have a red diamond square over their head. These soldiers have armed more than the regular Albion soldiers with typically an assault rifle. They wear white camouflage pants and a white shirt with a white vest and a white facemask that doesn't cover their eyes. As if they were going skiing. 

&#x200B;

**Blue Soldiers**

Blue soldiers are the same model as the White soldiers but with blue camouflage and a black vest. These blue soldiers tend to be more brutal than typical soldiers but not as brutal as Albion Captains. These blue soldiers are adept in combat and are equipped with usually an LMG and a baton.

**Blue Soldier Captains**

Blue Soldier Captains are extremely brutal and powerful. They wear the same armor as an Albion Captain and are usually larger than regular soldiers. However, the Blue Soldier Captain covers their face completely. 

&#x200B;

**Melee Soldier**

Melee Soldiers are extremely different as they don't use lethal weapons. Melee soldiers have a slightly different model as the Blue and White soldiers however Melee Soldiers are painted in red and bare black armor. Melee soldiers seem to be extremely adept in melee combat far more than the Blue Soldiers.

&#x200B;

**Melee Soldier Captain**

Melee Soldier Captains have the same model as the other Captains with extreme amounts of armor but they usually fight in melee.

It's not challenging or fun but an annoying waste of time.

I guess it would have elevated the game into another sphere if you were able to choose like three characters to be in your team that move with you and between which you can switch on the fly. Like that a much more complex gameplay would have been possible. Also with this, you could limit switching to other characters so save spots. When one of the team gets eleminated you'd have a brief time to revive/free them. If all of the team gets eliminated you had to restart the mission with a new group.

Half the borough missions have or end with some kind of forced drone segment, the spider drone is used for god even knows how many tech points and collectibles and tons of main missions have forced drone segments.

Ubi, if the goal of the operative system was to allow players a ton of different ways to play, why do you only ever seem to support one playstyle? I was kind of hoping the operative system would mean more open missions with more choice in how you go about things, and to be fair there were a few of those where I personally chose to use drones like the bombing site mission, but when you give me flight and the power to carpet bomb my enemies I'm not going to run up and punch them in the face.

Honestly I really like a lot of the other gadgets, but I have to swap to the spider drone so often it makes me want to forget they exist. So far I can count the number of times where the optimal play wasn't ""Fly in on construction drone, throw down spider drone"" on one hand, and basically all of those other situations were solved in a similarly linear fashion because Spy + cloak is disgusting.

I absolutely adore the beekeeper, but the overcharger has so little ammo I'm spent halfway through an assault which justs leads me to spamming infinite bees at everything, and since it's a loud playstyle I always have to deal with reinforcements and drones, so I pack the grenade launcher which ALSO has a pitiful ammo count and it just kind of sucks when you compare it to the cold efficiency of drone spam or spycloak.

Now, honestly I wouldn't want to change the construction worker or it's drone, or change the spycloak thing as they are in their own ways tons of fun, but for the future, maybe look at increasing the utility and power of other operatives and maybe not relying so goddamned much on the spider drone and forced drone segments?

My Honest Thoughts On Watch Dogs Legion,10,jm6ube,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jm6ube/my_honest_thoughts_on_watch_dogs_legion/,1,1604282856.0,KrazyxKangaroo21,"Well for those who dont like to read others opinions but still look at the first sentence. Its good but there is some definite fixes that need to happen.

Ok for those who are interested in my thought here we go. My first major gripe with this game, There is no ""second chance"" for my permadeath operatives, i understand getting into a gunfight would kill my operative but failing a fist fight? Thays what kills me. Did the albion operative i was fighting just use that baton to beat my head in. Either way it doesnt make sense atlease allow operative to be arrested in permadeath than just dying immediately.

But with a negative there is always a positive. Driving in this game feels amazing, I love how you can go from being on a major road pulling a handbrake turn into an empty alley and coming out onto a minor road. Or in my case not looking at the mini map while im exploring and driving right into a resricted area, Still fun though.

Now for the gun play. It feels, im not sure how to explain how it feels it doesnt feel bad, (btw i am on Xbox) several games have used the same style of gunplay and its normally in games where gunplay is not the recommended way to go. And it turns me away from gunplay. I hired an Albion operative because he had an M249 and the damned thing feels impossible to use but at the same i can run around with a Desert Eagle and a G36 as a hitman and just decimate a small army of them. But the gunplay is fun but feels unrewarding in some way

The hacking, My god the hacking is meh. Now when i seen trailers for this game I was excited to see what hacks would be available to me, wether that be new old or something weve seen before but was taken out in a previous title. And i was pretty dissapointed, i get not everyone can do the best hacking and cause underground steam valves explode and destroy pursuiting vehicles or things like that, but Watch Dogs Legions hacking feels like a stripped down watch dogs 2. I dont have a better way to get rid of a pursuit besides outsmarting the ai and making a few quick turns.

The AI. My god the AI is really good, granted it has to be when your giving a ridiculous amount of NPCs a daily schedule, several associates that they can interact with, and go out to lunch, and make sure that schedule fits with what they are doing so congratulations ubisoft you made actually good ai.... Please fix breakpoints AI teammates they are ungodly stupid.

Now im not done yet we still have one more thing to cover and thats quests. Now there is one thing i enjoy. The main missions, The main missions feel amazing but dont force me to recruit an operative when i more than likey could sneak into an area with an AR cloak and non lethal. Now recruitment missions. They are pretty repetitive but theyre not not really they may be the same objective wise but they all play very differently.

Anyways thats all if youve read this in its entirety Hello nice to meet you wish i could give you gold for getting this far but im pretty broke but overall the game gets a solid 8/10 for me for above reasons

\- Skilled characters will always be staying still or doing an event e.g.:

Getaway driver loitering around their car (Parcel fox distribution center)

Drone expert playing with their drone (Parliament square gardens)

Professional hitman targeting and garroting victim (North Southwark streets near St. George church)

Anarchist arrested or protest leader protesting (Protest spots everywhere)

Street artist spraying on a wall (Almost everywhere with slums)

Spy....spying on someone (Tower of London west side, City of London north west corner)

\- Liberated borough will have less roaming Albion guards, Albion oppressors and no check points.

\- Potential recruits can join when their contact is saved from oppression. Keep one districts oppressed and rescuing contacts for easy operatives. 

\- You can save victims by distracting the guards with hacking.

\- Instead of a karma system, this game will punish you from killing civilians by them kidnaping your operatives in a revenge side mission.

\- Civilians have schedules and they will reach their destinations though a door that you cant access.

\- Drone hijack is overpowered. You can hack a chase/riot/ct drone and clear a whole base from outside.

\- Police is more polite than Albion

&#x200B;

Thoughts (some details I wish were added to the game)

\- More voices and faces please.

\- Killing operatives contacts should make the operatives you have quit Dedsec and have another revenge side mission (like trying to tell Albion where Dedsec base is).

\- Operatives can gain new skill by doing minigames but unique skills like gun kata, shock drone or bees will always need unique operatives.

\- Civilians should evade your car AWAY from the road not onto it. too many times my road kill is from taking a corner.

\- Defied boroughs should have more people walking and loitering in public places, police and Klan Kelly walking around and harass people. Would love to see London Police Cars instead.

\- Hacking puzzles should have been updated to something else. frequency matching, the meter minigame (like dead by daylight skill check or Bioshock 2 hacking), or something like Deus ex where a type of antivirus/antihack will stop you. 

\- Bring something from previous games they should bring back ally way crime chases from WD1, hacking streets lights and pickup weapons.

I know a lot of you guys have found my guides pretty helpful and I've had a lot of requests to do some more. Unfortunately, my game save didn't work (can't say techy stuff otherwise post gets auto removed) so re-downloaded the game, and still didn't work, so I've had had to start again. But not to worry I have just completed Reporting for Duty and am ready to get recruiting.

I am currently in the process of making two more guides. One for a Hacker and one for a Drone Expert. I think there is a way to make my drafts public (btw I'm kinda new to Reddit) and so was wondering if you guys would want to see the progress I'm making, or you would rather wait until I have a full-fledged guide with at least 3 locations. If you guys say yes then I will attach the link to a pinned comment to this post until my full guide is complete.

Also, if you guys find any locations feel free to dm me.

Previous Guides:

and the recruit mission (Drone Expect) , both are remain unfinished (but the operative is here) and everytime i log in , the recruit mission pops up again

So the question is , how do i trigger an auto-save in legion ? i suppose playing any mission can do the job, right ? But i can't explain my situation.

If they ever get close to detecting me I just use the cloak and stand still. They announce about searching the area but they never do. Sometimes they climb onto obstacles and get stuck. When a single NPC detects a dead body only NPC's (including drones and turrets) close to him are alerted not the whole restricted area.

Play as anyone - hopefully a one time thing,2,jm4uui,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jm4uui/play_as_anyone_hopefully_a_one_time_thing/,3,1604276119.0,JohnnyTest91,"Playing the WDL for like 15 to 20 hours now, I really hope the play as anyone feature is a one time thing that will never return. It's a nice proof of concept but has so many downsides compared to more traditional character designs.

* The ability to play as anyone limits the game designers possibilities for character diversity. In a game where you can choose anyone to play, there will be limits to what characters are playable. In Legions that means a city with same sized people, no overweight people, no people with disablities, no children, etc. Diversity isn't to include lots of skin colors only.
* There is hardly any personality in the characters. Their voices are better than I expected, but still horrible. And some are really stereotypical. All the characters feel replacable though, like they literally are. There is no connection between the player and their characters and tbh I am at a point where I regret not choosing permadeath because I'd love to get rid of some ""weaker"" characters which are just fillers in my team. Useless fillers.
* That leads to another problem: No character progression. It's okay that you cannot do everything with a single character, Legion doesn't feature any character progression at all. Every character remains how you unlocked them. But that's also a waste of so many assets in the game, like there are so many different tools and weapons you will never play because of course you go for the best characters and don't waste your time with such that only have one or two abilities, even when they have a cool weapon or outfit or stuff like that.

In conclusion, I hope that this remains the one and only game to try this recruit anyone stuff. It's okay to have more than one character - but make proper pre-written characters, give them life and progression throughout the game.",Text,2020-11-01 19:15:19

What I did notice was that she had an accomplice, this was my only lead so I went to check him out, I was thinking of recruiting him to see if that would help but while screwing around I accidentally hacked a car and it ran him over, oops.

Anyways, I went to check on her deep dive and it had changed, she had a recruitment option that was something along the line of ""colleague waiting for treatment"", I investigated it and it turned out that I could hack a hospital to either euthanize him or bump him up the list, I bumped him up and she called us up wanting to join!

How to get money FAST,87,jln9x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jln9x6/how_to_get_money_fast/,25,1604197162.0,samplx,"There's an oversight in the game with recruits that give you money when you recruit them - you get ETO every time! This means you can farm about ~6000 ETO a minute. How?  
1. Recruit a person with the perk ""Signing bonuses"" (If you have one already, use them).  
2. On the ""Team"" screen, select the recruit and press F (""Show on map"").  
3. Go to their location and find them.  
4. Retire that operative (Select them on the ""Team"" screen, press Space to go into edit mode then press G and click the popup)  

That person stays friendly with DedSec, so upon recruiting them they instantly join you again - and you get ETO! Now, repeat these steps:  
1. Target the recruit by holding/clicking Scroll Wheel.  
2. Press Q twice to recruit them into your team and immediately bring up the ""Team"" screen.  
3. The recruit will be selected, so press space to go into edit mode.  
4. Press G to abandon and confirm the pop-up with your mouse.  
5. Repeat until you're satisfied with the amount of money you have or get bored.

It takes me about 3 seconds to recruit that operative and retire them, so I can do this process about 20 times a minute. Each time you recruit you get 300 ETO, so about 6000 Eto/minute. Have fun!

Now, don't get me wrong, it still has issues. But rather than say that it is flawed, I'd simply like to believe that it has a potential for improvement in future updates or maybe future installments of the franchise. It's an exciting prospect for the future of the series.

I'm finding it much easier justifying killing people in Legion though.

I can't remember if the bad guys in WD 2 were  as blatantly 'bad' as these ones are.

Last night, when I went to close to end my session I went through the menu and hit quit to main menu. Pretty normal stuff, except the loading icon popped up and then... Nothing. The game more or less froze up, I couldn't interact with the menu at all and so I decided to wait. And wait. And wait. Eventually, I figured whatever and just closed out the game via the taskbar. It shut down quickly so I figured all was well.

That is until today I log on and notice a few things. First of all, a bit of what I did hadn't saved last night. Not too much, just an hour or so of recruitment missions, and I still had the missions themselves so no worries. I also noticed, however, that I had a character that I had recruited to my team last night both in my team, and as a prospect. Sure enough I had the mission and potential to recruit him again, I figured it was best not to kick the beehive and just abandon that mission. Having two of the same guy was only asking for more trouble.

There were a few more minor things, like after every mission bagley would give me the opening line to another mission, whether or not it was selected. Oh, and a big one, completing those recruitment missions again ended up in the character not being added to my team. So now I really am losing out on potential characters.

At this point, I figure maybe it's best to shut down and open it back up again, maybe a solid reset will settle the code and let me play the game, you know? 

Well, it did the same thing it did last night. It just froze up with that loading icon doing its little animation and so I waited again, and again had to just force the game closed via the taskbar.

It’s how to farm specialists in Watch Dogs Legion. 

I’ve noticed that many of said specialists appear in certain locations, and many of us don’t like the ones that show up or are given to us by liberating Burroughs. So here are a few very easy steps to ensure you get the specialist you’re looking for. 

Step 1. Remove the previous specialist in your party permanently. Yes, you need to ensure that any current specialists you have die. The reason for this is that if you aren’t playing them, often times the spawn will populate with your current specialist. I tried playing as the specialist but this ultimately resulted in no one spawning at all. So kill them. 

Step 2. Load into the spot nearest the spawn point. (For example: Spy farming is best done by The M16 building.) 

Step 3. Check to see who spawns. If the spawn is what you’re looking for, great! You successfully farmed a specialist to your specifications. If not, shoot them. 

Step 4. Reload the spot and try again until you can accomplish step 3. 

Additional steps: Albion police tend to not like it when you shoot people in the streets. Grab the cloak gadget and hide until the heat goes away.",Text,2020-11-01 13:32:58

-	Work on optimization


-	Characters should wear clothes you give them everywhere, not just when you play as them
-	there should be option to safe own outfits so you can quickly change them
-	let us change hair/facial hair/color of them. I know it’s on list, but please don’t abandon this
-	Give us option to buy car and assign it to operative (could be on assign to one operative only) It will give even more use for money and people will love it.
-	let us transfer perk from somebody to somebody else. It would cost shit ton of money and it would be possible to transfer just one to person for example


-	in fight knuckle tournament, after you finish all 5 arenas, there are exhibition tournaments and champion have only two perks no matter what. I was hoping I will find good fighters there. But 2 perks is just too low in comparison what I can find in world. Please fix it
-	they should add chance for them to have more perks = be recruit worthy
-	they should add option to bet on us and make more money
-	they should add difficulties to make it more challenging = make worthy of more money
-	would be nice to see more side activities like pool, bowling, etc


-	UBI said the will add more characters with new abilities for free. Please don’t do just that, add new perks/abilities in current pool, so we have a reason to scan and look thru randoms.Otherwise most people will just get spy, Hitman and all will be same.
-	In general make it more random than it is now. Why not generate Hitman with ability to call drone for example, or anarchist with own car. Not every construction worker has to own nail gun, why not normal gun as randomness. Etc

It's busy work, and it would be tolerable if the main missions were any different, or if the mechanics of the game were fun and engaging. 

It's difficult to see how it could have turned out any different, purely based on the nature of the recruitment system and the design decisions that were made in limiting each recruit. 

So it begs the question: what else would you like to see in terms of mission varation within their formula that would make the experience more engaging? Because right now it feels very dull, repetitive and empty - especially for a game that looks so full of life.",Text,2020-11-01 13:08:20

After some experimenting, I've found that this almost always happens when doing right turns, and what seems to happen is that if you're doing a right turn from the left most lane, and an NPC is standing on the sidewalk, the NPC ""thinks"" that you're about to ram them... so they take evasive action by jumping to the side, right into the street, and you run them over.

Basically, you can do this yourself by inching forward in a vehicle towards a civilian. Eventually they'll do the ""get out of the way"" jump, which is basically identical. It also seems to be always in the same direction (your right, their left). So that's why it always happens on right turn.

My theory is that they have reused the ""get out of the way"" code from another game, which had right side driving, this bug would have happened on left side turns, and if they dodged right, while you're turning left, you probably wouldn't even notice.",Text,2020-10-31 19:15:18

In terms of where I am at in the story, I've only done a couple of story missions, having just liberated Camden and getting a second team member. I've made attempts to recruit 3 different people and the resulting missions always play out like.

1. Steal a car/boat/some intel
2. Break in to a lightly guarded facility somewhere and get more intel. 
3. Rescue someone from a heavily guarded fortress with drones and soldiers everywhere. 


This step 3 is where I always fail. In every instance it seems very clearly in need of some better tech than I have, or at the very least someone with a uniform (which is what I've been trying to get...). Is this what all recruit missions are like? Or am I just having bad luck? Or am I just trying to recruit people too early in the story?",Text,2020-11-01 06:19:35

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

so to start off i want to say that i love the game. but im kind of disappointed that we did not get a real dedsec. and what i mean by that is its missing that dedsec feel from wd2. they were a true team and did those cool desec videos and fun operations. this game was fun to play. but when it comes to the dedsec part. its lacking those memorable characters. sure we have a former dedsec hideout. but it just does not feel the same. in the first mission we got a tiny glimpse into the real dedsec london. and when we were introduced to sabine. i felt like she was the only link to the real dedsec the last surviving member. then of course she betrayed them. it upset me because i really liked her and when she betrayed us it was sad. and now that i beat the game and sabine dead. i feel like dedsec is really ded.

you might say hey we have our team of operatives. but i dont really consider them dedsec. more like a group of disgruntled citizens not happy with whats happening. in watch dogs 2. dedsec was supposed to be hard to get into. the first mission involved marcus having to prove to them that he is good enough to join. now in legion we can recruit people that know nothing about hacking or dedsec. and we have to do THEM A FAVOR. why should we have to run errands for them? yet they are the lucky ones to join the elite dedsec. i miss the old dedsec. and i hope they return in the next game. on a bright note at least we are getting wrench back. so that will feel better having a real dedsec member in the game.",Text,2020-11-01 03:58:35

My first character was an Irish lesbian cryptographer named Marie Bridgwater.  She's settled into the role of team leader quite nicely; taking charge on recruitment, giving rousing speeches, etc.  I've got that streamer guy from the online code, and I actually quite like him--he's like the young, way in over his head kid that turns out to be quite capable.  Lola Green is my hacker I got from completing the first Borough Liberation mission, and she's like the reckless maverick who doesn't give a shit about taking lives as long as the job is done.

I also recruited the reporter who lead me to Lola, and he's got ""dead meat"" written all over him.  He's fidgety and nervous, and he barely survived an Albion raid when we stole the AR tech.  Then rounding out my cast is a former Albion captain who had an authority problem and whose husband I saved from deportation, an Eastern European construction worker, and some burly chick with a grenade launcher.

They're ragtag for sure, which is how I like it.  And with permadeath on, every encounter feels super tense and keeps me on my toes.  Next up for recruitment is a spy I found literally across the street from New Scotland Yard, who wanted to join with DedSec after I saved his cousin from being arrested.  Then after that, I'll pick up a Clan Kelley goon who kind of looks like Lupita N'Yongo and has a chance of dying randomly.

Make a backup of your saves before doing this since sometimes the operative locks in and you will need to redo this. 

When you liberate a borough, the moment the ""liberated"" pop-up appears, immediately hit ALT-F4.

Go to your saves folder and make a backup of your saves in another folder (separate from the first backup you have just in case this doesn't work the first time and the operative gets locked in) 

1. Start up the game and check your team.
2. If the specialist isn't to your liking just quit the game (ALT-F4 is faster than quitting through menu).
3. Delete your saves and replace them with the backup (second) you made.
4. Repeat step 1-3 until you get an operative you're happy with.

It's a hell of a lot faster/easier than going out searching and it shouldn't take too long before you get someone that is to your liking.

I copied the originals and kept the save folder open. Once I got into a good rhythm (ALT-F4, Ctrl-A, Delete, Ctrl-V) it took me  less than 1 minute to quit, restart and check out my new operative.

I was so blasted away by everything. First of all... the play as anyone system was really well done. I felt excited when recruiting someone new. I loved how they could kidnap anyone of your team if you wronged any random person and I was motivated to free the boroughs because they gave you a skilled operator after doing so. Overall, great revolutionary system that could be the future of AAA games.

Gunplay felt pretty much the same but with some amazing weapons. Easy to master and great variety. Melee combat was something new in the series and was well done. It was really nice. Also, the Bare Knuckle League was awesome!

Now, onto the story! SPOILER ALERT! TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T LIKE THOSE! 

It was really amazing in my opinion. Dalton was a nice character that even though I knew for a short time I felt genuinely sad for when he died. The villains were well done, much better than the second game. I had an easy time hating them but also appreciated just how badass, evil and well done each of then were. I didn't find that the multiple characters interfered with how I enjoyed the story. I loved it. Although I did main that Spy and El Rubius quite a lot... well, what are you gonna do?

BIG SPOILERS BRUV!

I had that sneaking suspicion that there was more to Sabine than we could see and when she was revealed as Zero Day I felt betrayed yet satisfied that I was right. It made me feel even worse for Dalton boy since he was killed by someone he considered a friend. I thought we would get a boss fight with her but still was satisfied as she fell off the Blume building.

And finally, Bagley's death. I really loved Bagley throughout the story and I looked at him like a funnier, sassier Jarvis. I felt heartbroken when he said the only way to stop Sabine's plan was to kill him. Even before dying he was a funny prick. And I... I cried you guys. I cried when I killed him. But then we salvaged him from a random ass drone so it was fine in the end.

In conclusion, my personal opinion was that this game improved on the previous installments a lot and the story felt dark and gritty unlike the second. Felt more like the first. I loved the play as anyone system and for me it didn't interfere with the story. I loved the factions like 404 and I liked that I could choose the fate of... fuck I forgot her name already.

[MASSIVE SPOILERS] Some Brief Thoughts After Finishing the Story,4,jlqs1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jlqs1w/massive_spoilers_some_brief_thoughts_after/,5,1604209528.0,Lord_Antheron,"The pacing is... not what I had hoped for. That's how I can summarise it best. I'll likely write up a larger post in the future, but this is what I have off the top of my head right after finishing it.

I will say that they integrated the presence of ""play as anyone"" into the game very well. I never had a situation where an operative interacted with a story character and it felt stiff or artificial. They did very well in that regard. Even the random conversations with different operatives had a nice flow to them. 

The main story itself though felt like it was going to be something great, but... it didn't feel that way.

There are five major villains in the game. 

Larson, Cass, Kelley, Malik, and Sabine. The story treats them as extremely disposable. Main campaign seemed shorter than half the campaign of WD1 and WD2. 

1. Skye Larson is defeated less than five missions after she is even acknowledged. 
2. Mary Kelley is given so little screen time that she's nowhere near Lucky Quinn. For a Human Trafficker, I barely ever got the impression that she was this monstrous queenpin. Her death -- likely meant to feel cathartic and karmic -- felt empty and meaningless. 
3. I did not expect Malik's betrayal, but he slipped through our fingers for about 25 minutes of playtime with the right operatives before we got ahold of him again. 25 minutes of playtime was what I spent unlocking the Bunker in WD1. What was that other person's name, Emma Child? She kidnapped one of our mates, tricked us with the car, suddenly pulled a quick ""aha, Malik is evil!"" but then Malik pulled another ""aha, I let you know that!"" and then he killed Child offscreen and... it felt like the least climactic game of cat and mouse, and all it ended with was us putting him the time out corner. Hooray. 
4. Nigel Cass was exposed so easily and he broke down so quickly that all the buildup around him felt pointless. I can barely make sense of his motivations. Was the ""good man"" he let die his father? I know that his father was killed by gangsters, but this is barely brought up. The second phase of his boss battle is pathetic. He emerges in a special suit of armour, and all I had to do was lob a single EMP grenade at him and then fire a few rounds into his wrinkly mug and he went down. That's it? That's all he has? 
5. I knew Sabine was suspicious from the start, but her sudden shift to a deluded ""technology bad"" hag came out of nowhere. When I replayed WD1, I could see a few subtle signs that Clara was afraid of Aiden and harboured some kind of guilt over what she did. And when she died, it actually felt impactful. She wanted to do better, and it tragically took her death for Aiden to forgive her. And I think I forgave her in that moment too. But Sabine just... okay, she falls to her death, and that's it? That's the extent of the confrontation? 

Everything flies by so quickly. And I went out of my way to recruit as many operatives as I could, take on side missions, and max out my tech. But each individual arc (if you can even call it that) is 90% buildup, 1% climax, and 9% resolution. It's just so... easy. It never feels like there are any stakes. The villains never feel imposing. It suffers from the same issue Far Cry 5 has. It has an abundance of characters with great potential, but it wants to cram all of them into this plot so it goes through them so quickly. 

I won't deny that they've accomplished something pretty great with this game, and I eagerly anticipate the DLC. I plan on playing the whole game with just Aiden, Darcy, and Wrench, because they'll probably feel like set protagonists and that may mitigate the issue of the villains not being related to the operatives at all. However, I play these games mainly for the story. And while I am happy to make the stories of the operatives on my own, the villains just... let me down. Maybe I'm entitled or my standards are too high, but I was really looking forward to WDL having a better plot than WD2, and going back to having antagonists who were truly threatening and needed to be stopped like in WD1. Yet it's so bland.

Bagley was the best part of the story, and killing him hurt. But the story ending on such a somber note, where we kill him and then the game just... ends. It felt unearned. It felt like the only thing that mattered, when the bar wasn't even that high. Gah.",Text,2020-11-01 01:45:28

Many people are missing the entire point of the recruitment system and other choices in Legion (long read),543,jl0o3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl0o3i/many_people_are_missing_the_entire_point_of_the/,217,1604106162.0,CapeManJohnny,"Disclaimer: This is a video game that we each paid for in one way or another, and we're all allowed to play it exactly how we want, and have whatever feelings about it that we want. This is strictly my opinion on why the recruitment system works perfectly, and why Ubisoft's experiment with player choice has been a resounding success.

Most people would agree that Ubisoft tried some pretty experimental stuff with Legion, but I don't think that the recruitment system is the most experimental or unique, I think it's the amount of **player agency** that we've been given.  This entire game seems to be a subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) statement on **freedom** and **choice**.

I've spent the last hour reading this sub, and half the posts seem to be complaining about various things, some seem understandable (stability issues on pc, big missing hacks from the others games \[blackout comes to mind\]), and some seem far less understandable (whining because the menu isn't presented as a phone anymore, not being able to read NPC's texts), but one of the big recurring themes seems to be that a lot of players don't enjoy the fact that this game doesn't give you a written backstory for the operators, and that being able to play as anyone is leaving them feeling like none of the operators matter because there is no personal investment in them.

If we had certain operators or recruit-able companions that had large, drawn out backstories and motivations for joining DeadSec, it would quickly force the recruitment system into the same ""**this was cool for 5 minutes, now I'll never think of it again until 3 years from now when it's not part of the next game and I'll complain that it was a series-defining feature that is completely irreplaceable and it's now ruined because of its omission**"" novelty status that we're experiencing right now with other flavor content. If we had a template ""hero"" character (or even characters), there would be absolutely zero reason to ever switch to anyone else, completely nullifying the recruitment mechanic as a whole.

This game just requires a touch of role playing or imagination to fully enjoy how it works, because Ubisoft is not spoon feeding us a novel-like story made into a game, instead they're giving us a build-your-own-adventure book and letting us come up with part of it on our own.  Instead of looking at my recruits as ""RNG characters with the same 4 recycled lines, no depth or back stories"" -(stolen from another reddit post complaining about the system), I've given them each their own backstory specific to how I envision it.

I'm looking at them as a bunch of normal people who are pulled into DeadSec because of abnormal conditions, not because they want to be fugitives/freedom fighters, but because they know something is wrong with London and feel compelled to do something about it. Inspector Finch in the V for Vendetta film makes a great analogue here. He's a law abiding citizen - who is literally a part of the system - that we get to watch transform throughout the film, not because he's ruled by vengeance like V, or (at risk of drastically over-simplifying her motives)because his attachment to V like Evie, but simply because he knows that what's happening is *wrong*.

My construction worker is just a blue collar guy who knows what's going on is wrong. He doesn't need to have a huge life-spanning backstory on why he's jaded at the world, and will risk his life to change it, because he isn't  - he's just a working man who is tired of going to work and seeing his fellow Londoners being brutalized by this militarized police force. He doesn't want to die, he doesn't want to go to prison, or be kidnapped off the street - he just wants to see London be free again.

My professional hitman? She's completely different, but similar enough in the ways that matter.  She's lived her life as an assassin, working for the highest bidder and not giving two fucks about much else, until Albion came along.  She doesn't have to be a saint to know that what's happening is simply wrong. She understands that even though she's spent her life being a butcher, she doesn't like the way her country is headed - and she sees that people without her abilities are rising up to do something about it, so perhaps she should.

And it goes on for every one of my team members. As soon as someone joins, I ask myself what would compel me if I was in their position - and run with that. We do the same thing with certain characters in books.  I think a good example here is Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series.  We're given small tidbits of Dumbledore's past over the series, however we're never given the same insight into his motivations as we are characters like Harry or Ron. Instead we're given some building blocks but allowed to fill in the space between them. That's all I'm doing with my operatives in the game, I'm taking what I was given about them, and filling in the empty space, which has led me to care about them. I'm playing with perma-death enabled, and I find myself afraid when situations escalate far more than I intended, for my character's life.

&#x200B;

The same concept of Ubisoft intentionally leaving in things that could easily be described as overpowered, once again is a result of giving us more freedom than traditional games.  The cargo drone is a perfect example here. I've seen several posts talking about how it's overpowered, yet we're completely given the option on when to use it, outside of the **very** few missions requiring us to move items with it.  Riding around on it can essentially break every outdoor encounter, allowing you to skip vast swathes of restricted zones, and go straight towards your goal - but only if you want it to.  I found myself using it too much yesterday, so I restricted myself to only using it when exploring or hunting for collectibles. Same thing with the spiderbot infiltrator.  I used it for the first several missions and realized that by doing so, I was making the perma-death setting pointless - as I was never actually risking my operators. I was hovering over the area in a cargo drone, dropping my spider as close as I could to the goal, and using it to finish the objective. If it died, I'd simply wait for the cooldown timer to reset, and do it again.  So now I'm going to limit myself to specific characters using it like the drone controller and hacker in my team.

It's completely fair to say that you don't enjoy the amount of choice that you've been given, or you think they could have done something differently - but I don't think it's fair to ridicule the choices made by Ubisoft without at least recognizing that they are giving us a monumental amount of freedom in a narrative-driven game, the likes of which is often only found in sandbox settings.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I think Ubisoft made a conscious decision to allow us more **freedom of choice** in this game than any other WatchDog game (and perhaps any other open world game as a whole) and it seems that a lot of people are missing that. They're looking at the lack of scripted backstories for our operatives as laziness by the developers, instead of a blank slate on which they can write their own backstory and personalities for their team members - and I think that's missing the amazing opportunity that this game is giving.

Anyone else feel that every feature in Legion is kinda 75% done/good?,107,jl9i1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl9i1a/anyone_else_feel_that_every_feature_in_legion_is/,64,1604135855.0,Tensor3,"Edit: yes, I missed some things that the game does have or explain. It's just a first impression.

Maybe I'm just being too picky, but it feels like everything is just a bit off to me. From graphics to gameplay to UI, everything feels a bit half-assed. They seem to have maximized quantity over everything.

Gameplay: All characters the same. Shooting has a weird diagonal/sideways recoil.  Only one ""ability"" and most don't really do anything unique. I can't tell when it saves and it constantly loses progress. Too many pointless recruits everywhere and not enough direction to anything. Ammo is apparently universal to every gun, everyone gets the same gun, and I cannot pick up equipment from enemies. Hacking and the ""puzzles"" are overly simplistic, at a toddler level. Everything has the same hacking option and hacking never seems to do anything interesting or unique. The world is supposed to be ""dystopian"", but everything seems too clean, well-organized, wealthy, and smoothly-running, and yet no one notices if I run around destroying/stealing everything. Dialog is corny, voice acting subpar, and story underwhelming. Boring missions, repetitive gameplay. Melee combat is pretty terrible. No shop interiors.

UI: There is no indication if mission objectives are below/above me or inside/outside. No distance to objective. The objective descriptions seem vague. I can't tell what my HP is (I know how this style of HP works, but this implementation of it seems unclear) and it seems to fully heal almost instantly. I get popups to ""ctrl"" to hide on objects all the time, but inconsistently. Auto-driving doesn't seem to go to my objective and doesn't let me choose when/where to turn. Lots of time wasted trying to get to the next pointless repetitive thing because of poor UI.

Graphics: Lighting bugs. The water looks like colorless, detail-less, melted plastic with ray tracing--worst I've ever seen in a game. The textures of trees and bushes are blurry, very low resolution. The puddles are mirrors and everywhere at all times. The cars in unlit tunnels are shiny lit up mirror monsters. Some objects have insane detail, while others have none. Everything concrete (benches, walls) is just a flat, pristine concrete tiling texture with no marks or discoloration or nicks or different edges or anything. Performance is awful. Graphics don't feel like they fit together right somehow. Very repetitive assets; all the cars at the same.",Text,2020-10-31 05:17:35

Recruiting a Hitman in Watch Dogs Legion,334,jl27g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl27g6/recruiting_a_hitman_in_watch_dogs_legion/,102,1604110995.0,TRICKYTOMSTER,"There have been a lot of people asking how and where to recruit Hitmen. I recently created a guide on how to recruit a spy and a lot of people found it very helpful. A lot of you requested for me to create one for Hitmen. So here it is.

The Hitman is a skilled operative that has 3 default skills. 1. Desert Eagle + G36 - The hitman comes equipped with a pretty beefy arsenal. The desert eagle packs a punch against enemies and the G36 is great at holding off bad guys and assaulting holdouts. 2. Gunkata - this trait allows for instant takedowns with a gun. To perform it when fighting someone pull out your gun and hit them and the Hitman will instantly take care of the trash. 3. Combat Roll - this trait allows for the Hitman to roll away out of combat by double-pressing the jump button.

However, as with the spy, you can find Hitmen with a fourth trait.  These can range from being old and fragile, to being physically fit and able to take more damage. It is basically just RNG.

**DISCLAIMER:** You have to have completed the Reporting for Duty mission in order to begin spawning skilled operatives. This mission early on in the game and specifically it is when permadeath sets in. 

**The first location** is in the City of Westminster borough near Brewer St. station. As you walk out of the station immediately walk across the street into the ally on the right. If you travel here at night you will have the chance of encountering a Hitman completing a job. Don't approach them instantly wait until they have killed their target. Because if you kill them they will hate DedSec and deny your attempt at recruiting them. After they killed their target save them to recruits and then open the deep profiler and then begin recruiting them. Hitmen spawn mostly during night 20:00 - 04:00.

&#x200B;

**The second location** is near the bare knuckle boxing arena in Camden. At the North of the map in the borough of Camden neat the fist icon. If you travel to the bare knuckle boxing arena in Camden Town at night then you have a chance to find a Hitman. With this location, they can either be standing around or completing a job. This location tends to be best at night. 23:00 - 04:00. Credit - u/signguy21

[ Location 2 - Camden in Camden Town around the Bare Knuckle Boxing Arena 23:00 - 04:00 \(Night\)](https://preview.redd.it/1skdk334y9w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bca2a5d854cad2e63febf06e016e6eea51298ca)

&#x200B;

**The third location** is in China Town. In the City of Westminster travel towards Brewer St. Just South, East of the station you should find China Town. Walk down the main avenue and you should find a Hitman either just finishing completing a job or standing against a wall smoking. Go up to them and add them to your recruits. Remember to wait until they have done their job. This location I believe works at any time. I have found videos and Reddit posts saying this location has worked both during the day and at night. So for the moment, I'm saying that this is a permanent spawn no matter the time and just RNG if they show up.

&#x200B;

[ Location 3 - City of Westminster in China Town \(Any-time\)](https://preview.redd.it/d57s7739y9w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c389e026033fa4810f5c1d6ee25a3af88a0134bf)

Hopefully this helps anyone looking to get a Hitman operative the most action-packed operative. I will be updating this post so please comment any other locations you guys have found.

Also, if you are looking to get a Spy I have made a guide for that as well.

I'm incredibly surprised at how much effort and detail went into the tone and design and details. The characters just seem fun too! And the mechanics and how creative you can get with them is so intuitive! 

Why was this so under the radar around the time it came out? Is it just because the first game fell really flat? I'm almost bummed I didn't try this sooner when the online world was more active.

Not sure if I'll get legion or not since I need a strong protagonist to make me play the game. Since Legion doesn't seem to really have one to play as I might only hold out on another sale or gold edition.

\- Can't buy guns

\- Lethal guns are totally unavailable except for certain characters

\- Can't change vehicle cameras

\- No shop interiors

\- Can't zoom in with iron sights guns anymore

\- Terrible lip sync

\- Can't play music on foot

\- Can't choose songs

\- Can't favourite songs

\- The radio will often play the same song over and over, and seems to reset the radio every time you get into a new vehicle.

\- The talk radio starts it's conversations over and over again

\- Your character never gets stronger, just stays the same but with a few different tricks that barely change anything

\- Have to exit spiderdrone to recall it 

\- Can't change gadgets in combat or restricted areas, meaning if there's no spiderbot spawner, you will have to leave the area, go into the menu, switch it, and THEN throw out your spiderdrone

\- Radio stations all look the same

\- Stylish parkour moves are gone

\- Cover will fall apart if you run into it too hard

\-Can't pick up enemy weapons, and there are NO biometric locks, so there's zero reason why.

\- No way to play audio logs outside of the menu, no way to play them while walking

\- Terrible soundtrack, not even close to the awesome tracks of WD2

\- No cover-to-cover

\- World map is at an awkward angle, and you can't switch the Y or Z axis at all

\- Quick hack has been defaulted to Q, and not middle click. This makes hacking way more difficult, as instead of me just using my mouse, I have to move my hand off of movement keys to press it. Stupid idea.

\- Can no longer hide in a vehicle

\- Impossible to lose police, they rubberband to you

\- Police randomly target you for no reason, or somehow know you're the person who shocked someone remotely, despite the fact the street was full of people who could've done it, seeing as everyone's insanely skilled with technology now.

\- No ScoutX

\- No in-game menu like Watch Dogs 2's phone, everything done out of gameplay.

\- Clunky shooting mechanics with almost no recoil

\- No more Dedsec videos

\- No more unique Dedsec operation artwork/animations.

\- Objectives are put on the other side of the map from eachother, to artifically lengthen the game.

Also, my game must've glitched out? Because I never saw a single resistance activity on my map, meaning all Boroughs were impossible to liberate, and I was stuck on the starter pistol for the entire game. Any other stuff I missed?

The recruitment system is a great basis but needs to be more fleshed out.,20,jleqg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jleqg5/the_recruitment_system_is_a_great_basis_but_needs/,5,1604160841.0,Ch33z3M0nk3y,"I love the direction Ubisoft took with this game, making every NPC playable is an awesome idea but I feel like there are some huge missed opportunities. 

Right now I have a construction worker that I like because of the ""backstory"" I came up with for him and the clothes I put him in. In case of his death I'll be sad...for a second, then I'll recruit the next worker with the exact same set of skills I have already saved to my list of recruits.

Your recruits should feel more unique in my opinion, you get more attached to them and feel their loss more. 

A system that maybe adds a skill depending on your playstyle with that certain recruit would be great to make them stand out. For example a character you mainly use to recruit others could get a skill that allows him to be better at that by being able to instantly approach characters that dislike or hate DedSec. 

Or a fully fleshed out skill system that allows you to develop your character in their certain field of expertise, a hitman for example could invest points (you could get by doing missions with him, that only count for him, not like tech points) in a perk that allows him to customize his weapons. 

They could also go a different route and make the operatives ingame jobs matter more, recruit a barber, you can now change people's haircuts in the HQ, same for a tattoo artist, a CEO of a big company joins the team? He now gives you unrestricted access to his companys building if there is one or gives you the option to trade in stocks. 

I just want to feel the loss of an operative more than just the annoyance of finding someone with his exact set of skills and maybe similar or just good looks. 

Another thing that I feel would be an amazing addition is the option to actually work as a team. You have all these specialists and right now your gameplay is limited to the operative you chose to play as. 

An option to call in members of your team before infiltrating a restricted area would be absolutely amazing. While you are going in, doing the dirty work, your hitman goes to a nearby roof, taking out enemies that spot you. If you want the non lethal approach maybe a drone expert sends in one of his buddies to distract the enemy. 

The getaway drivers make a great example, their skills are only useful after you infiltrated a building, not during the actual job, they look like they were designed with a system like that in mind (maybe the online mode but I feel like it's a bad design choice to withhold such a feature from single player only players). 

Of course this could get overpowered, some of the skills and characters would probably have to be overhauled but playing as a team would really fit the ""legion"" part of Watch Dogs Legion. 

I feel like Ubisoft is on a good way here but the system needs to be a little more fleshed out.",Text,2020-10-31 12:14:01

I just think that story mode had no taste in it and was kinda unfinished.

"[No spoilers!] Legion isn't the same, but it's still a fantastic game.",11,jlel3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jlel3x/no_spoilers_legion_isnt_the_same_but_its_still_a/,4,1604159966.0,RainForTheParade,"First off, I want to start by saying that I've loved the games, and played 1 quite a few times, and 2 is easily one of my all time favorite games next to a couple other 'greats' I have.  


To me Legion is fantastic, but it's not the same as 1 or 2. And it's one simple reason, the lack of a set  'protagonist.'  


First off, I think the 'APC' take is amazing, and honestly they really went all out. But the problem is that while these characters can be great and all, they don't amount to the quality of a single character that a writer came up with in most cases.  


Sure some of them are great, but how many times have I recruited someone for him to be pretty much the same character as another I already have in my small roster? Too much. Sure the voices and tones sound different, but the words and phrases are the same.  


I wanted to love legion, I really did. I was perhaps even more excited for this game than I was for Cyberpunk 2077, and I'm honestly a bit let down.  


The new progression system isn't as fun for me, though I'm sure it's a blast for others. I miss being able to be a 'hipster merchant of death' that WD2 gave me as Marcus, upgrading him from a simple hacktivist into a force to be reckoned with.  


But WDL doesn't give that. Sure some have a few abilities, but most aren't worth it, or their hair and features are just bogus. For example I found a hitman with Gunkata. Which was wildly amazing, and honestly a real catch in the wild. Though he just looked like someone pressed 'randomize' in a character creator and it took all the most unappealing aspects and put it into one character.  


I also dislike the constant change of my character in some missions. I finally found the one character I liked enough to play the entire game after around 8-9 hours of recruiting and stuff. Only to find out that some missions force you into other characters. You can of course swap back, but the loading screen really kills the vibe and immersion.  


Overall it's a great game, but I just don't feel that it's a 'Watch Dogs' game.  
I feel that other than the fact that 'Blume/CToS' and 'Dedsec' are there, there isn't much that really makes it a WD game for me. Granted this is my opinion, and my preferences from the series are not the majority.  


And also, they really took out the inside of clothing shops. Sure it's a small thing, but it was hugely important to me, and really made the world just feel more alive. Wish they brought it back.  


Though they did knock the ball out of the park with the amount of clothing options and styles. not to mention you can adjust for hood up, zipped and unzipped, and much more. Though I still want to be able to wear laptop bags with an unzipped hoodie.  


I'm hoping the 4 'hero' characters in the DLC \[Especially Wrench\] will really spice up the story and give real personality to it, but with the way it's designed, I'm more afraid that won't be the case.  


I also miss the 'botnet' and 'charges' from 1 and 2. Sure the cooldown is nice, but I'd prefer having to manage my specific usage to how much I've chosen to unlock instead of just having no limit and waiting 20 seconds to be able to disrupt someone again.

Overall to me it's a good game, but I don't think it's the same as 1 and 2.  


And while I'm sure this post isn't going to be popular, I just wanted to vent somewhere. I'm sad, but not heart broken.",Text,2020-10-31 11:59:26

Recruiting a Spy in Watch Dogs Legion,419,jkvr91,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkvr91/recruiting_a_spy_in_watch_dogs_legion/,100,1604089442.0,TRICKYTOMSTER,"A lot of people have been asking where to recruit a Spy. From the time I have spent looking, I have managed to find 6 spots that almost guarantee a Spy to spawn. Each at different times. (With the help of some Redditors)

The spy is a skilled operative that has 3 default skills. 1. P9 Silenced - A suppressed P9 that can easily take down most enemies with one shot to the head. 2. Spy Watch - A unique skill tailored to the spy that when activated can jam enemy weapons for a period of time allowing for a hard-hitting takedown or a quick getaway. And 3. A Spy Car - A classic vehicle on-demand with the ability to launch missiles and turn invisible for a short amount of time allowing you to escape your pursuers.

However, if you get lucky you could find a spy with a fourth trait. These can range from being old and fragile, to being physically fit and able to take more damage. It is basically just RNG.

**DISCLAIMER:** You have to have completed the Reporting for Duty mission in order to begin spawning skilled operatives. This mission early on in the game and specifically it is when permadeath sets in.

**The first** **location** is near Westminster Bridge. On the south side of the bridge in Lambeth, head towards the County Hall. Go through the archway towards a giant digital clock that shows time in different time zones. On the left of the reception doors you should find a spy, I've found they tend to spawn around 17:00 to 23:00, usually in the evenings.

&#x200B;

**The second** **location** is near the Tower of London. It is right at the bottom right-hand corner of the City of London borough. Head towards the tourist entrance to the Tower and turn around to face east. Towards the side road. Hopefully, you should find yourself a spy and his car (where the guy in red is standing, who is a spy I have already recruited. These guys tend to spawn around 23:00 to 04:00 usually quite late a night.

&#x200B;

[Location 2 - City of London near the Tower of London 23:00 - 04:00 \(Night\)](https://preview.redd.it/yq2334xq38w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d2c1dd57e73b5068d6389b75ea40c40fe04f60)

**The third location** is at and around the Tower Hotel building. Head over to the Tower Hamlets borough and right next to the North exit of Tower Bridge you should find the MI5/6 building. The Spy will spawn in the parking lot opposite the burger food shop. Again next to their car. However, also with the location, Spies can be found walking around the building on the street. The last time I visited here, I found 2 Spies. One in the default spawn position and one that just happened to be walking near the building. This Spy tends to spawn in the afternoon. Around 12:00 to 19:00. In the image I collected for this post I managed to find one at 18:00.

**The fourth location** is at the Caromont Hotel in the City of London borough. Towards the bottom right of the borough just to the right of London Bridge you should find the Caromont Hotel. Head towards the parking at the entrance to the hotel and you should find a Spy by their vehicle. I found one here at midnight. So I assume this is a night time spawn. Around 19:00 - 04:00 (Night).

&#x200B;

[Location 4 - City of London at the Caromont Building 19:00 - 04:00 \(Night\)](https://preview.redd.it/8kodybs1p8w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=314466607d0e6b782b9103d69333843175c20f65)

**The fifth location** is at the MI6 building. It is right along with the south edge of Lambeth next to the river Thames. Head towards the front of the building (street side) so you are staring at the entrance. On your right, you should find an ally. Head into the ally and you should find a spy next to their vehicle. Redditors have commented that they could appear both during the afternoon and night time. Credit - u/Shizzlick and u/EH_Sparky

**The sixth location** is in the Big Ben car park. In the borough, City of Westminster near the Big Ben. If you fast travel to Westminster station, grab a car or run around to the south side of Big Ben. There you will find a car park. In the car park in the afternoon, you should find a spy. During the afternoon 13:00 - 18:00. Credit -  u/-Jusek

[Location 6 - City of Westminster in House's of Parliament car park 13:00 - 17:00 \(Afternoon\)](https://preview.redd.it/x0vuunbau8w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a5a5ad54735696766ed89aa9ed4e9b6c47dabde)

If you don't find the Spy you want make sure to check them on the deep profiler first. They can have competition from other spies so might know the location of another Spy. Credit - u/WizardDresden77

I tried hiding inside a building where that omnipresent, unavoidable, somehow-as-fast-as-a-supercar police-chopper couldn't see me, but the cops just camped out in front of it and STAYED there while NOTHING HAPPENED. The wanted-level doesn't go down, at all, ever. I tried hiding out in some backyards where I could easily break line-of-sight for my ground-bound pursuers, sniped the chopped, waited... nothing happened. Wanted-level doesn't go down, helicopter eventually returns, repeat.

WD2 cellphone feature was fantastic. Even you can hear music when you are on foot, you can get into multiplayer, check multiplayer, map (even though you can press M to show map but it was cool.) etc...

Small suggestion to add a system in the future for this game.,3,jlj4py,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jlj4py/small_suggestion_to_add_a_system_in_the_future/,2,1604182740.0,Aidan697,"One of my main issues with the game is it feels like there is no character progression in this game, yes there is the tech tree to go through but why not think about adding a dynamic system wherein you can train the people you recruit. 

Think about this, you find a hacker early game that has a couple nice perks that you like but then you are locked with that right now there is no progression to that character. No unlocking new perks or working on overcoming the short comings they may have.

What if after you clear a borough and you get the elite unit instead of getting that unit you unlock the elite training for that type of unit. So now your lowly hacker you got at the start of the game can start their elite training to become even better over time, you can then have it so it is random what other perks you get and even get to the point where it may give some negatives to these different trees if you don't train the right way.

This to me would make building your roster a lot more dynamic and make it so you get more attached to your characters as you have to spend this time with them to unlock their elite training. You don't need to then get rid of these elite units that spawn in the game very rarely but make it so your little street-rat you start the game with can become an elite hitman you have put the time into them with. 

This is only a suggestion that should give players more of a sense of progression with your characters  while also getting you more attached to them so it feels more meaningful when you mess up on your Ironman play-through and get swarmed by too many guards.",Text,2020-10-31 18:19:00

A) The controls feel clunky. I have found trying to do a number of things has not felt very intuitive.

B? The utter lack of onboarding about what the controls are. I know there is the ""Tutorials"" option in the menu, but within the game itself, figuring out how to use drones, items, etc. doesn't really get taught to you at all. I've muddled up a number of early missions simply due to errant button presses, rather than consciously making poor decisions. I'll accept some culpability for this, but I really wish this game had done a better job familiarizing its players with the control scheme.

Hard should be normal. Or somewhere between the two should be normal.

2) The pretty lame enemy AI, simplistic stealth system, and anemic enemy backup response means that it's way too easy to just brute force any area.

3) The character recruiting is a really cool gimmick, but the game fails to actually make you use any specific character type. Would be a way more interesting game if it forced you to complete missions with certain specific character types, or ones with sub-optimal abilities.

4) The best characters are too good and need more weaknesses to balance them. Certain character types shouldn't get to use certain equipment or tech at all, but instead have some other big advantage.

5) Permadeath should probably just be the default setting and only option, to actually try and give the game some stakes.

6) Why can't I listen to audio logs/podcasts/music while just running around doing side stuff? I literally just ignore that entire part of the game cause being stuck in a menu or vehicle to have to engage with it is ridiculous.

7) The only side activity that seems well implemented is the bare knuckle boxing, and it's over too quick. My God the darts, and 'kick up' are terrible. Package delivery is meh. Where's all the drone and vehicle races from WD2!?

8) I appreciate that killing pedestrians or enemies can have positive/negative effects on recruiting future operatives. But since there are so many to choose from, it just ends up feeling pointless. I'm not going to Deep Profile some guy and actually read all that crap.

9 The cargo drone is way OP. You basically have to force yourself not to use it on order to actually enjoy the environment navigation puzzles. (Also, these puzzles were noticeably better in WD2)

10) Whole game just seems to be lacking that special 'soul' that pulled me into WD2 and made me love the rag tag hacker group. Bagley the AI is interesting at least, everyone else is forgettable.

To sum up: I still think this game is fine, and I'm still having a decent time playing it, but I think once I liberate all the boroughs and finish the story, I won't revisit it.",Text,2020-10-31 12:01:52

I liked the more adult atmosphere in the first game and darker tone to it. No flashy suits or masks no kids being hackers. And What I like now is that wd3 is more of what I wanted from a watchdogs game. But there are still minor things that I dislike like hacking being less represented throughout the game world compared to wd1. Characters are not customisable, which is a must if you go for this random playable character approach IMO. Just changing the clothes isn’t enough. And god those masks are so childish. I hope aiden pierce will be just the same as in wd1 with his dope look and all. The only thing that I would change is basically having fixed characters for every part of the city that you unlock that are good designed characters.

TL;DR If your shipment was delayed, Ubisoft may have sent you a key for another copy of the game.


So I preordered the gold edition for Legion. Lot of stuff happened during than, and it seemed like Ubisoft did whatever they could to screw up shipments. Fortunately, it mostly meant delivering it early, so it was alright.

Unfortunately for me, my copy arrived late. Only a day late, the shipment got delayed, but that was enough for Ubisoft to say sorry and send me a key for the standard edition of the game, so I could play it despite the delay. The key was useless to me since I discovered this after I had the game in my hands.

My dad had the bright idea to send the key to my friend. I did. And it worked. So there's that. But who knows, maybe your shipment was delayed. If it was you may want to check your email. My friend who bought the collector edition of Legion had his shipment delayed the same time mine was, so I was thinking this was a thing that happened to a lot of Legion copies.",Text,2020-10-31 18:33:22

•Pros:  
\+Well Designed open-world map, it looked amazing in every aspect and many landmark places are here + the advanced world feel was really there, drones flying around, people getting confronted by Albion, excellent work here.

\+Gameplay to a certain degree: The gameplay is pretty much a blend of 1 & 2 and I’m all for it, I’ve always really enjoyed the franchises‘ gameplay, at first gunplay felt weird but I got used to it and gunfights were pretty fun, drones helped make them more challenging. Stealth is also pretty fun, I enjoyed the multiple takedowns and gadgets at hand.

\+Play As Anyone: It’s been the main marketing holder for legion and for the most part it really wasn’t just a bland system, it was much deeper than expected and I’m still looking forward to recruit more as I play.

\+Story Villains: The Story villains here aren’t extraordinary, but I think they were entertaining enough to keep my playing and wanting to push through, better than watch dogs 2’s by a mile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now For the Cons

•Cons:

\-Driving Felt Odd: The first WD Game felt Fine, second was the ideal driving system even if not perfect, I liked the flow, here it felt way to easy to take directions and didn’t really fit in my opinion.

\-Lack Of Stealth Innovation: The jump from watch dogs 1 to 2 in terms of stealth was massive, you had drones to scan the area, you can now use multiple traps for 4 uses, throw lures and more, it felt like a true jump forward, here it feels quite the same, with even less thing such lack of a lure gadget, there is an throwable EMP but it directly shocks instead of giving me the option to do what I want.

&#x200B;

\-Story Characters: By this I mean how there is no feel of personal connection, there are many cutscenes were my character is saying things on his/her own but I cant stick it to their personality as any recruit of them will say the same. Therefore the story suffered from this, I lacked the care I had like with Aiden or Marcus.

&#x200B;

\-Mission Variety: This is one of my biggest complaints, while the first games did have similar mission structures, the breakup for a set-piece mission occurred more, here I feel like I do 3/4 missions of infiltration for one big confrontation or heavy story material.

&#x200B;

\-Oh, and bugs :| & facial animations 

&#x200B;

•Overall, Legion didn’t disappoint but it also didn’t surprise, I enjoyed my experience, even though flawed, it was a fun story to go through and I’ll be playing after and messing around and seeing what London has to offer, the game gets a rating of \[8/10\] for good.",Text,2020-10-31 13:29:55

So this has happened twice, once before and after the updates. With the Ultimate edition you get those three additional operatives. I've been playing as one of the three Ultimate Edition Operatives, they then die, obviously the rules of Ironman are that when an operative dies you lose them forever, so, it sucks, but it makes the lives of the people a bit more meaningful, at least to me. It also makes me pay very special attention to who I would like to use for a mission in order to avoid someone dying if I pick the wrong person.

Anyway I like playing as Gabriel Isa, mainly for his MP5 Silenced. Anyway, He died while I went AFK to make coffee yesterday, stupid, I know, but I thought I was in a safe place when I obviously wasn't.

So he gets removed from the game, then a bit later on I log in and I look to change operatives and it says ""Gabriel Isa - New Operative"", I thought that was weird, so I kept playing. I felt like it worked out given that he died because I went AFK.

Anyway that brings me to an hour ago, I'm trying to beat the community challenge for the week (Yeah, thats not going to happen, in two days I think we've done less than 2% of the total, I doubt we will do the next 98% in 5 days, but why not try).

So I'm blasting the Albion guys trying to get a level 5 wanted level, run out of Amo, Gabriel gets roasted. Then my game freezes, I reset, low and behold the dude is in my team as a new Operative again.

I think the problem is that I log into the game and the game says to itself ""Ok, this is an Ultimate edition, so they get the three special operatives, they currently have 2, so I will provide the third one they got with their edition"" and then hands me whoever I've lost.

The problem with this is, now I'm not really doing Ironman am I, because you lose the game if all the Operatives die, but they can't all die if they keep resurrecting them. I mean I'm grateful I didn't lose my favourite character but it entire undermines why I selected Ironman in the first place which was to really feel the pain of my fuck ups.

Kinda hope it gets fixed.",Text,2020-10-31 06:33:58

I'm glad I did. It's not a game worth buying but more than $15 worth of effort has been used to make this game. [normal & ironman mode, kept most settings to default]

So the first hour into the game and through the tutorials, I go and complete a burrow real fast I unlock a Jamaican hacker operative with his voice pitch-shifted deeper for some reason, it's goofy and I love it! Then a few more missions and operatives into the game and the pattern becomes evident skills are just a class system randomly assigned. I guess really mixing and matching would be too rough for them to balance? 

Plot-wise... well it's lacking... the bad guys are bad. Got it. It's all kind of duh and illusion of choice without meaning. A bit like watch dogs 1 where they wanted you to feel bad for killing people or running people over. They added some additional consequences so that's good.

NPC's are a bit derp... they jitter around corners and don't put up much of a fight. They do at least use cover but they always peek it's just a bit predictable in a bad way. It could use some more randomization. I do like that NPCs will just chatter and there's still faction fighting so if you're being chased by Albion just hide in a clan kelly zone.

So I did enjoy some of the random characters, pitch-shifting them was bad, some sounds in-game need work (driving through a wooden fence for example is just 300 plunk sounds on repeat)

PSA for anyone like me who didn't know; Don't try to break your operatives out of jail.,4,jldpjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jldpjj/psa_for_anyone_like_me_who_didnt_know_dont_try_to/,5,1604154717.0,antiquatedCreator,"I just spent twenty minutes leveling a police compound that my map pointed to after my op was arrested (his aunt was in the lobby to boot), but upon attempts to Albion my way into its depths (and subsequently failing, because my disguise fails in less than a second within line of sight for some reason), quickly escalating into me executing everyone on my way into the basement.

But my operative wasn't there. Ten minutes or so left to spare, I kept searching the place for any jail cells I may have missed, but no dice. My operative was theoretically there as far as the game was concerned, but damned if they'd let me spring them out.

I have a gripe about this. Albion shouldn't even let suspected DedSec members out of jail, considering what we know of them. They vivisect the people they capture, but let DedSec go free? Even without permadeath turned on, there should still be a big incentive to rescue your allies from jail, especially if the game lets you find the station they're being held at.

Sorry if I somehow missed a big thing and turns out I can actually save them, in which case, egg's on my face. But from all of my looking around? I wasted my time and should have just done something else for the thirty minutes he was locked up.",Text,2020-10-31 10:31:57

to preface this, im playing hard mode with no permadeath. im also on the Xbox 1 S so this is mostly targeted to other xbox players but if you share these issues feel free to chime in!

The crashes. Oh lord they are bad. Sporadically occur, usually during my first hour or so playing. this is pretty basic, yea, but i wanted to cover it

NPC (or... AI? whatever we call them in Legion) or cars just disappearing when u look away from them. for instance i was in southwark driving around and saw a nicer car then the one i was in. pleasantly surprised by this (because southwark seems like a bit of a shithole) i quickly turned around and it was just... gone. Noticed a similar problem with NPCs just randomly appearing right in front of me! 

Drones. Entirely. Is it just me or do drones fucking suck in Legion? i try to go into a cinematic car chase with some drones on my tail  but they loose me in less then a minute and then they literally just disappear to the fucking shadow realm or something! they also have a habit of not spotting me when i drive or run past them.

Enemy AI in general is.. lacking. It takes me only about 45 seconds to a minute to escape Albion. I dont want that all the time. sometimes a chase is really fun!

Ive seen AI kind of slide about 50 feet on the ground in like 3 seconds flat. small and bit funny of an issue. this one isnt so bad.

When first starting a session of the game and spawning in, whenever i view the ctOS profiles around me the photos of the AI show up as big white blocks. They usually disappear after a minute and I can see the faces again but it persists EVERY time i boot up the game.

and one more thing! this isnt really a bug, more a feature that pisses me off a fuck ton, but when taking down Albion soldiers harassing civilians the Albion dispatcher is contacted via psychic link and sends a dude after u. I hate when games do this. WD:2 did something similar when being detected. if u got detected once in the last game, every enemy in the area would be message psychically by the guard who you would likely be taking down. It feels lazy.



Anywho, thats all I can remember off the top of my head. feel free to add anything or confirm these bugs in the comments! thanks guys!",Text,2020-10-31 15:38:09

I realize the whole idea of the game is to have a team of many different experts and switch between them as the job requires, but it is kind of a bummer that there is no way to upgrade Operatives skills at all, which means you are basically forced to either use agents you gain from Borough disruption or to get lucky and find someone with decent skills out in the world.

The hideouts are fun to run through but taking out guards and defenses is way too easy right off the bat. The map is ok but all it has is objectives and collectibles scattered, not really anything worth exploring at all. Visually it's not anything impressive and the removal of stuff like mass hacks, vehicles, etc and even minor stuff like the phone menus and music player shows how much more couldve been worked on. Having fun atm because it's not a god awful game by any means but I'm probably not alone in being very disappointed. Hopefully ubi doesnt turn wd4 into shovelware and hope the title is enough to make up for its long list of shortcomings like Legion.

The voices in this are atrocious...,7,jl5npa,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl5npa/the_voices_in_this_are_atrocious/,19,1604122134.0,tenpastnein,"Disclaimer: I've only got about 10/12 hours in the game so far, but I've done a fair amount of exploring.

My main gripe is with the NPC voices. All the white males I have recruited have the same, posh Eton voice whilst all the black male operatives I have or even black male NPCs that I have come across are Jamaican. It just feels like a crude caricature. 

The matching of voices to personalities is also terrible - I have a construction site worker who speaks as if she were in the Royal Family and then an Albion captain with a distinctly European accent - no issue there, barring the fact that Europeans are persona non grata particularly where Albion is concerned.

I was hoping that the extra 6 months would have really allowed them to flesh out the NPCs, and whilst it's undoubtedly improved there is still so much that needs tweaking. Which is a shame, because there are some awesome improvements in this entry (melee combat, driving).

it often happens that when I close the game after finishing a mission, and restart, I find myself at the beginning of that mission, even if between the end of the mission and the close of the game I did other activities like switching operative or collecting stuff.

Today, something even weirder happened: I closed the game during one mission where I had to save a kidnapped operative but when I restarted the game the title of the game save is correctly ""Feitong Ma kidnapped""  (as you can see in the image below) but when I load that save I find myself without that mission (the operative is not kidnapped) and with the last story mission I already did marked again as incomplete. Moreover, I seem to have lost one operative without any trace (additional bad luck: it's a spy that I used in a couple of missions already).

My honest review after a few hours of legion (a first impressions of sorts),20,jkygv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkygv3/my_honest_review_after_a_few_hours_of_legion_a/,7,1604099215.0,the-reddit-user22,"This post is for people who are curious on other people thoughts on the game (of course). 

A couple years ago I got Watch Dogs 2 and while I didn’t think it was the best game ever, I thought it was a lot of fun and really enjoyed the concepts presented. I personally gave it an 8/10 (other games I’d rate 8/10 are dead cells, modern no mans sky, and rainbow six siege) as besides the bugs and the story being so-so it was really fun. Now legion has come out and of course I was eager to see what was next for watch dogs and while I wouldn’t say they hit it out of the park, I definitely think they made something kinda special.

I’m sure anyone on this sub already knows the deal with watchdogs legion so let’s get straight to the reviewing. First the graphics. Not gonna blow your mind but they certainly are far from bad. Don’t expect it to be better than 2 though, I’d say legion is more consistent with its graphics but it doesn’t reach some of the heights that 2 does. Textures are good besides some of the fire effects and stuff (like 2) overall you shouldn’t be bothered much by it. Character models are hit or miss. Some look good while others look like mass effect andromeda.

Story and voice acting is eh. Bagley is surprisingly enjoyable and probably my favorite character but the main story itself isn’t very strong even by Ubisoft standards but that’s for a reason. It’s not bad but I personally haven’t gained anything from it so far and I feel like I would have been the same had I just skipped cutscenes so far as a lot of exposition is already given after the cutscene ends. The play as anyone system doesn’t help either, it’s decent but isn’t gonna give you the same kind of quality as you would with one protagonist.

However I’m sure people expected this, what people really wanna know is how is the gameplay? Well (in my opinion) it’s an absolute blast. I have stated multiple times on this sub that it seems they ditched a lot of the random goofy stuff for more substance to the gameplay and while whether you like that or not is up to you, to me it has worked to insanely great effect. The world itself is extremely alive thanks to the NPCs and the systems in them and how they interact. In combat and stuff they aren’t the smartest but they certainly do enough damage on hard mode to be somewhat formidable (though I turned off aim assist so that could be a problem). But in the world you can see some pretty neat stuff and that is added based on the character you play as. I find it really cool how playing as an Albion guard clan Kelly members will push me around, I love when you arrest someone nearby Albion guards will guard the person (though I think you can’t let them see you do it or else it counts as an execution). There’s just small stuff like that that can pop out from the world that is just so cool. Combat here is better than the other 2 games like combined. The melee system is perfect for this kind of thing as it’s not so complicated you can get lost in it but it’s more complex than just pressing x. Gunplay is also pretty good and mission structure added on with the play as anyone is really fun. Recruiting people as well is also just loads of fun and feels like going on a separate quest line. I got so deep in it that I hadn’t attacked a single stronghold on my own as I was so deep in doing missions for possible recruits.

The open world is pretty standard. I’d say the strengths with this one is the enemy territory design as all the places to attach are pretty fun and interesting. There aren’t shop interiors but there are plenty of interiors throughout the open world that you can enter freely and just mess around in. And the recruitment system allows these interiors to actually have a lot more substance than 2. In 2 almost all interiors were locked behind missions, only like the entrance, or small shops. In legion there are legitimate places like full on buildings that you can freely go into and actually have substance to them when you need to do missions. I was so happy when I found out that you could enter the shard at any time and wasn’t some big raid mission. Besides the enemy bases though, there isn’t as much fun little things here as there is in 2. Everything here serves more purpose than just messing around and that’s evident through the nature of them. Darts and keep up And bare knuckle boxing are all things to do for recruitment missions. I personally like the approach of having a lot of things serve purpose but it is kinda sad that there isn’t as many thing to just mess with.

Hacking has been dumbed down sort of. I feel the hacking in itself has way better usage in this game but it’s only better usage of the basic hacks you already have seen. There isn’t really anything new besides the deep profiler and a lot of hacks have been removed like calling gangs or cops on people or exploding cars while they are chasing you. 

I haven’t really experienced any glitches or anything major Just the usual buggy AI every now and then

In summary so far legion has a lot more bite than bark compared to its previous entries. Unfortunately it abandons a lot of the more sandboxy open world fun activities and trades it for a different kind of experience with a lot more substance. It has some rough voice acting bits and the story is alright, but the gameplay systems are so entertaining that I can’t help but enjoy it. I have heard many technical problems though and again there are things here that will bother people as it’s a lot less of a traditional watch dogs. 

Personally I rate it an 8.5/10 it’s better than 2 but not by a humongous amount. I could definitely still see people going back to 2 every now and again but personally I think this one has a lot more to it that I enjoy.",Text,2020-10-30 19:06:55

1. Levelling up inactive operatives

I know why this feature was removed. Levelling up a character and having them die after you invest in them but this could work in  a few ways. While your operatives are not on mission, you could train them up in a variety of ways so that they are more capable of competing with the better operatives. There might even be people you could recruit who would be better teachers. A tree of talents and things an operative could focus on would be sweet. 

Some specialists would still start fully or mostly trained, but it could be theoretically possible to get rookies 'close' to the standards of the specialists. Would still suck to lose them, but it wouldn't as costly in terms of time, grinding and effort if done right. Plus customizing the training of operatives 

2. Calling for back up from inactive operatives

Saw this one elsewhere and its a solid idea. Need a drone? A getaway? A distraction? A sniper? You can call for it. Granted game might need to be a bit harder or have some more difficult settings but it could be useful. 

3. Sniper rifles, both lethal and less lethal 

Dunno if I just haven't come across them yet (mostly wandering around looking at people to recruit for the giggles) but there are times where I want to act, but the target or usually targets are just too far away. In addition being able to change characters weapons up a bit should be a thing. 

4. Aesthetics

In general this could be improved.  The shops are a mess, I know some people miss walking in but in my case it's more a matter of not being able to find specifics as easily, especially when you see other characters wear things I want for my own. 

It's a pain going to each and every shop you come across and still not finding what you want. Plus some shops are way more common then others. I also know that there is a possibility of hair and facial hair changes being put in so there is that. 

Also on a person note and this one might sound odd, but I want my character to wield an umbrella. Either as a weapon/gadget or even just cosmetically. I spend a lot of time walking around, like I have one guy who I make out to be an recruiter/intelligence gatherer who silently helps people being bullied and gathers information and will do some ops if he can avoid getting his hands dirty and is usually the guy I send to talk to people. He wears a suit and tie so it just feels off whenever it rains. I like the rain personally but yeah just a very personal pet peeve. It was doable in Bully of all games and there's obviously animations for it, so let me do it :D.",Text,2020-10-31 07:01:05

I’ve decided to uninstall already...,0,jlirq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jlirq2/ive_decided_to_uninstall_already/,13,1604181337.0,Dr_Viv,"I’m around 10 hours in and have decided to uninstall the game. 

This isn’t a shit post for the sake of doing so... I think the game has some great qualities. Visually at times it looks great (not stunning so not sure why it’s so badly optimised). And the abilities can be fun to mess around with, including the idea of recruiting anyone which whilst isn’t executed perfectly, the fact they did something new here should be applauded.

However, Ubisoft should really be nailing this franchise on its 3rd try and learning from WD1 and 2 and in some cases I feel they have gone backwards.

My issues are:

1) terrible script (including the acting). The humour isn’t satirical and at times is just cringeworthy. Londoners May say “fuck” all the time but the script is off. 
2) the city of London feels “not lived in”. Architecturally it’s beautiful but I’m talking about the people within. There isn’t enough interaction with each other... road rage, cyclists, drunk people outside bars, people in suits (thousands in London)... as a Londoner myself, I can say the game looks like London but doesn’t behave like London. Something GTA nails in terms of its atmosphere in making the city feel alive (think of the beach areas vs city areas).
3) same/similar mechanics in freeing a city as with other Ubisoft games. PLEASE stop with these tried and tested “go here... pull a lever in an outpost... then go here and do the same”. Ubisoft need to scrap these mechanics entirely as they bleed over all their franchises. 
4) story is garbage and in particular the missions are not varied. Again.... using GTA it RDR here m, but the missions are standout. I can’t think of one memorable mission in the game.
5) sounds are lacklustre, in particular the music within cars. I feel I’ve heard the same songs over and over.

And the biggest of all.... it just doesn’t feel new. It feels tired... the mechanics underneath are creaking and ultimately I haven’t been hooked on this like I know I should. 

As always... opinions people. Mine is just mine and doesn’t make it right or wrong. I’m sharing though as I guess ultimately I’m disappointed and was hoping for so much more, because personally the premise of Watch Dogs is more exciting than Assassins Creed. It has the ingredients of an Orwell/Bond crossover that could be both gritty and brutal. 

I am surprised as the praise this game is getting with score of around 8/10... personally I’d be close to a 6.",Text,2020-10-31 17:55:37

Watch Dogs Legion is shit,0,jlmbty,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jlmbty/watch_dogs_legion_is_shit/,14,1604193936.0,Hider_Best_Boyo,"After replaying watch dogs 2 before this game came out and then playing WD3 it is crazy how shit it is. I’ve had more fun playing WD2 in a 30 minute segment then I have the 8 hours I played WD3. If you want reasons why this game is shit here you go

Removal of Botnets and certain hackables - Botnets let you strategize weather or not I should use 2 to distract someone or use it to move an object, the cool down system makes the game a lot slower and annoying. Once you completed WD2 and got all the botnet upgrades you could go around and mess around with shit and cause chaos by moving cars to make a traffic jam or turning on headlights to crash cars. You can’t do that anymore now you have to wait boringly and just hope no one sees you during missions and can no long cause chaos. The hackables in this game are very lack luster and lack variety 

Tech Points - Tech points are fine but the Tech point skill tree is an sorry excuse of upgrading. The old skill tree let you unlock increasingly crazier hacks to use on your enemies. You could get a massive blackout, make your drone drop bombs on people, send gangs after people. Now we can get upgrades like different drones that barely change anything. It’s very disappointing and gives less variety to the game

Characters - Now I don’t mind the new Idea of reciting characters I think it’s a cool idea. But with that idea you have to get rid of the skill tree, which is bad for the reasons above. The character variation in this game is cool but I miss how it was just a rag tag group of hackers trying to stop a company from taking peoples privacy. It feels less about real hackers and more about random people who just happen to know what a button on a phone is. Also most of the characters personalities are very bland and unoriginal 

Extra stuff that was removed for no reason - The removal of the phone menu sucks ass. I loved how easy it was just to get a picture for scout-x and call ins car. Now calling in a car is a character ability and taking a photo does nothing. The removal I hate the most is the removal the ability to walk around and listen to music. The change makes no sense to me and is honestly confusing. Another change I don’t understand is how stores and wardrobes work. Every store feels the same and sells the same shit, there is no variation. Also removing store interiors is probably the worst thing. Being able to put a bunch of cars and explosives in a store and blowing it up was so fun. But now without it the stores feel lifeless and feel the same. Removing the store name of an item in your wardrobe is also a very shit change and makes it harder to find clothes. 

Missions and Open world Missions - some missions in this game are fun like the fighting arena one but the main missions feel like I’m doing nothing compared to WD2’s missions. The main missions are go here, hack thing, go here, hack another thing. The missions in WD2 felt like I was actually doing something and during the stealth missions it felt like I was a real hacker trying to infiltrate an area. Now it’s feels like someone else is doing everything for me and all I have to do is go to an area. Also the open world missions, the red areas around the map, have some of the worst AI placement and item placement I’ve seen in a long time. Including the way you can tell if they are spotting you or not it makes the areas agonizing to get through.

Sorry for the rant but I needed to get it out. From a fan of the Watch Dogs series I feel like this game is a disappointment and not worthy to be part of the watch dogs franchise. If you thought of picking this game up, don’t. If you don’t have WD2 please play that instead it is a much better game than WD3 in so many ways",Text,2020-10-31 21:25:36

(TL:DR at bottom)

Dont get me wrong, the game is fun and beautiful to look at, i enjoy it for what it is! But to call this “the best watchdogs game” is a huge stretch in my opinion

Playing as anyone is a great gimmick in theory and in practice, i like having my operatives chime in on some things when they arent being played, i like the different way some speak during the story, like a ex military brit being all serious, a drunk irishman pmuch just doing as he’s told and whatnot (and granny, granny is great for the story lmfao) 

but some accents just dont fit for the story or the character sometimes, the “INNIT BRUV FUCKIN MENTAL BLUD” characters suck and ruin the story’s tone, tourists born & raised in canada sound like posh brits, etc. When some operatives interact outside the story (recruitment missions) they sound like they’re just saying their lines in a booth not talking to another person

The abilities & hacking in this game also feels so restricted, unlike in watchdogs 1 & 2 you cant blow up a holstered grenade in legion (you can find an operator with a skill like it, but as a hack on its own its just gone.) the blackout/mass disruption hack is gone, hacking bank accounts is gone (pmuch replaced with a inferior random chance eto gain upon any hack skill) hacking roaming bots from WD2 to distract guards or annoy npcs is gone, placing warrants/hits on npcs is replaced with an inferior albion handcuff skill (which works against you when used on guards) road traps are gone (aside from barriers), hiding in your car is gone, opening your phone for music, pictures, cars, repeatable side missions, etc is gone, weapon customization is limited to what your operator has (why cant i replace granny’s lmg with a desert eagle?) and just so on and so on.

Customization is also just... meh? I can make my characters look good (clothing options are nice, wish more sunglasses were availablw) but whats the point if operatives default to their ugly outfit or cant wear a mask 24/7, also wheres the half masks like aiden’s? (I ended up just giving everyone gas masks)

As for personal issues the spoken operative audio gets choppy at times and the city cant keep up with me during chase sequences, causing the game to freeze for a moment.

**TL:DR** game is fun, it has alotta good moments, good customization & some good VAs but to call this “the best watch dogs” is a stretch when its restrictive & missing many things from the previous 2 titles & has some bad VAs that sometimes dont fit the character, conversation or story at all & has some noticable & annoying bugs.

As for an ending note, take this post as my review after beating the game. Obviously our opinions may differ and i dont wanna spoil your fun at all. you deserve to enjoy the game, but for me i just cant call it the best, its good but not the best outta the 3

i do think the game will get much better as time goes on and more updates come, im very much looking forward to NG+, online and bloodline.

I know my PC and my graphics card isn't the best one, but I'm not expecting some RTX 4K graphics, yet after playing Watch Dogs 2 and GTA V for a few weeks while waiting for WD:L, this game looks pretty bad. In the 2 older games I got both stable 60 fps and graphics that looked really good, sometimes even amazing. In WD:L I get 60 fps some of the time, often it starts dropping a bit, and when I start looking at water it tends to drop to 20 fps. At the same time the graphics look really washed out, like the game was 10 years old.

Just feels very underwhelming, unpolished, and a bit boring in terms of narrative. Visuals also seem very dated and unpolished technically.

The controls feel clunky and heavy, like they needed more time to be polished, especially the driving. The driving feels delayed in terms of input response and just doesn't feel fun which is disappointing. Combat is okay with some cool melee sequences but again feels clunky and delayed. Audio doesn't always sync up with what's going on either.

As far as missions, they seem a bit stale so far. Nothing stands out as unique or fun. They've all been a bit samey. Also, due to the fact that you can play as anyone, it diminishes the narrative a bit, especially the voice acting. Feels more like an online game with a story tacked onto it. The aspect of playing as anyone is a cool concept, just hurts certain parts of the game.

Honestly, as of this point, I enjoyed WD1and 2 much more. They had a few extra things this game doesn't and had a more consistent. narrative.

* Mass murdering Albion or civilians does not make Deadsec hunted on sight or disliked by civilians. I'd love a mechanic where the more times you murder Albion, theirs a chance for them to send a squad to hunt your characters down.

The system isnt bad at all, it just lacks dept because everyone is almost the same and the abilities arent that unique. The most important parts of the gameplay can be accessed with any character and all that makes them different from one another are secondary non essential skills and tech. And uniforms.

I love how they made it more about the people than the crew itself, unlike the 2. I love that there's much more hand fight than just gun shooting everyone. I love that they stopped using the boring puzzle thing over every damn hack.

But I feel like the ""collectible"" content is a bit poor. I only made the 2 or 3 first mission, so I might have not unlocked everything ? (I hope...cause so far no ""spying on people private life through their webcam"", no races,  no random side quest besides the recruting) I mean I would rather have more than 3 missions to unlock a region and less of collecting random emails, you know ?

I played for something arround 12 hours and London is free, i got my squad complete, enough green credits to buy all the ameliorations I needed, so it seems that the only thing left is the main story. I hope it's long enough and that it unlocks more ""activities"" ? So far i have the pub mini games, the painting and the fight club.

Also I realised a bit too late than setting the difficulty on normal with no permadeath were big mistakes. I basicaly only played the first agent I got and she never got killed/ arrested/whatever could happen. 

And I dont consider myself realy good at videogames or trying realy hard to get a platinium trophy or such, the point is not to brag about how easy i do stuff blablabla, I'm just legit worried that the game is ""short"" in terms of content ?

Aiden had a clear end goal and motivations and while he wasnt really likeable you could understand where he was coming from. The gameplay of WD1 was also really fun mainly because of the focus ability, using that ability and the takedowns really made you feel like john wick. Free roam in WD1 on the other hand was not that good, outside of the main story, I found myself getting lost and that's what made it hard for me to get into the watch dogs series, the side missions and activities like poker were just fine. Story 7/10, characters 7/10, gameplay 9/10, and free roam and side missions 4/10 **Overall 7/10** is 20 dollars at base price right now so I would reccomend getting it (you can also get it in a bundle with WD2 that usually goes on a sale from 20-10 USD total)

**WATCH DOGS 2** had an entertaining story that kept me engaged through the whole game, but it wasn't as airtight as the first games mainly because of the lack of direction (take down big brother). The characters in this game are much better (I am exited to see wrench again in Legion) even though aren't represented as much as the characters from the first game, they have so much personality and are always fun to be around. The gameplay in this one is really good and although it doesnt have the focus ability from the first game, the drone and hopper ad this new element to the gameplay that really promotes strategy. The gameplay feels similar to the first but with some tweaks to make it feel new. Free roam in this game suffers from suffers from quite a bit of the blandness the first one did but it does have some good parts to it like more easter eggs, gang hideouts, special cars, etc. Screwing around with friends in multiplayer is so much fun though. World hacking in WD2 is much better then WD1 and Legion. Story 6/10, characters 9/10, gameplay 9/10, free roam 8/10 **overall 8/10**

**WATCH DOGS: LEGION** feels like a mix between the past two games but at the same time so different. I feel like something that hurts watch dogs legion is that its thought of as ""watch dogs 3"" when in reality, its is more of a spinoff of the watch dogs games. So, let's get to the ratings bit. The story is done I'd say its around the same level as WD2 while it has a clear end goal (find and take out zero day) it just doesn't FEEL as strong as WD1 or even 2. The characters in the game (the actual ones that are hand crafted) are actually decently intresting! Sabine is that badass/zero fucks/leader of the pack type, Bagley is a charming sidekick that also holds as a comic relief but is we couldnt function without him, Nigel cass is a villain who thinks he is in the right but is batshit crazy and there and there are a couple more I'm too lazy to list. One thing that will drop the characters down a bit is that there are  not that many that actually impact the story with their dialogue because of the recruit anybody feature! Yes all the characters have their own dialogue, voices, and looks bit they all kinda feel like one person; And yes,  when you literally have the ability to play as anyone, that is going to happen, these games are made by people, not super smart AI. The gameplay of watch dogs legion is in my opinion is the best out of the 3! The play as anyone feature ads SO MUCH to the gameplay. I love how you can infiltrate each kelly/Albion facility in so many different ways (guns-a-blazing, stealthily, in disguise, with drones, etc.) And all the different perks of each operative ad so much that wasnt in the first two games. Finally, the free roam. The free roam in this game is also really fun, Its like you are always finding something to do IN MY OPINION! For example: you could be walking around town, and see a potential recruit with an ability you like being harassed by Albion so you attack the Albion guard and evade the police and have a new recruit. There are also quite a bit of activities to do around the map like boxing or darts wich are surprisingly fun! (I hope multiplayer adds more like it did in wd2) Story 6/10, Characters 5/10, gameplay 10/10, free roam 9/10 **overall 7.5/10** but there is more being added to potentially bump the score up",Text,2020-10-31 14:40:22

Once he looks up from his phone and sees the person on the ground in cuffs, they walk over to them and just guard them.

It is also worth noting that an Albion police car will ever show up to actually take them to any sort of facility.

The albion officer who is guarding the person will ocasionally make death threats towards them. They will also make sure the cuffs are on tight enough. Sometimes they will aim the gun at them, for no reason.

Despite this, you can free the guy right infront of the cop and he wont do anything, but he will chase the ""suspect"" down, and cuff them again.",Text,2020-10-31 07:19:26

Will I ever be able to unlock/purchase real guns for my operatives that dont start with real guns? Or can you only enjoy shooting and killing with the Albion/Police/Hitman, etc. type of operatives who start with access to guns? 

It really ruins my interest in recruitng and using operatives who may have neat abilities but dont have a real fucking gun!",Text,2020-10-31 01:21:26

Legion is a significant downgrade from Watch Dogs 2,90,jkod9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkod9u/legion_is_a_significant_downgrade_from_watch_dogs/,75,1604053312.0,Queef-Elizabeth,"I  really hate feeling like a negative Nancy right now cause I'm sure there are some very appealing features in this game that make it a better experience than 2 for many people but I'm sorry, it is staggering to see how many features and mechanics have been omitted from previous games and this whole 'recruit anyone' system just does not feel worth it.

In just 6-8 hours of playtime in Legion, I have noticed the removal of:

\- Pop up phone menu

\- Car stealth

\- Move to cover button

\- Music finder or being able to listen to music outside of your car

\- Music playlists

\- Hacking options

\- Many shop interiors

\- a likeable protagonist

\- No more gang warfare

\- Citizens don't call or report you to the police if they witness you committing a crime

\- Car garage and customisation (although very mild in 2)

\- any effort put into free running

&#x200B;

On top of that, melee combat is a chore for the most part and just isn't fun with the operatives I've been given. Pressing square 3 times and then triangle doesn't make for engaging combat and I'd much prefer the one button attack 2 had. But Ubisoft had to forced in enemy health bars once again into their games so that enemies are damage sponges and it just takes me out a bit. The game also performs really poorly and is consistently buggy as I've had times where I got on a motorbike only to be flung 20 metres down the street, in the middle of a pursuit.

Something about this game feels off. I understand that some sequels remove features to make way for something new but this just feels like a total regression for the franchise. The recruitment feature is awesome in theory (and in practice at times) but it seems like it came at a cost of all the nice little immersive details that were in the previous games and imo, it doesn't work anywhere near as well as it should. Ironically, in their attempt at doing something unique with their property, Watch Dogs feels more generic than ever in the way the open world functions.

And one more thing, the lack of any protagonists (once again, while cool in theory) just doesn't work for me. If you're going to commit to something so daring, it has to be done perfectly and so far, the dialogue feels plainly robotic. It doesn't feel like two people having a conversation. It feels like 2 voice actors in a recording booth going through their lines. And on top of that, voices barely match the faces of the characters.

The game has its good sides, like the city of London being a breath of fresh air to explore and the effort being put into having every NPC become a player character with their own recruitment missions (although I foresee the missions becoming rather repetitive as the game goes on) but I'm having a hard time getting over the lack of neat features that gave the series some life in the past.

Do you think we will ever see the mind/soul being put into a machine? Would you give up your aging mortal body for an everlasting android like body?

The game is rather quiet aswel. There's not much ambient noise for a massive city like London. Just very echoed like chatter from NPC's.

I don't think you should get into trouble shooting your gun at Clan Kelly's with a Albion Operative. When YOU get shot at. It makes no sense.

Legion is the First Watch Dogs I Have Really Enjoyed,56,jkpg5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkpg5p/legion_is_the_first_watch_dogs_i_have_really/,12,1604057459.0,CroftSpeaks,"You know when you read a bunch of takes and wonder whether you're playing the same game as everyone else? That's me right now, reading some of the super negative takes here. Legion is a great game. I played WD1 and liked it fine: I found the incongruity between the narrative and the gameplay to be jarring; I didn't like the main character, who I thought was just dull and a bad person; the world seemed grey and uninspiring to me; I thought the hacking, though genuinely new and interesting, was over-complicated and obtuse.

I got WD2 for free when they did the giveaway and played about half of it. I liked the colorful world, I thought it was more appropriate tonally than the first one, and I enjoyed some of the side characters. But I didn't feel the writing was strong (it wasn't as funny as it thought it was, which is really dangerous for a satirical work), and the story was a mishmash which just sort of lurched from one thing to another. The characters didn't feel connected to the world - too floaty, with the over-dramatic animations common to Ubisoft games of that period (ones which make you feel less connected to the action because of the disconnect between your button press and the result). I liked the range of ways you could interact with the world, but didn't find myself invested in the world enough to care to do them.

Legion, for me, hits the sweet spot between the two. It has a more serious and weighty storyline than 2, without being grim and humorless like 1. It tackles contemporary themes in a competent way, which makes it feel engaging: when I successfully liberate a borough of London from Albion, I feel GREAT because I actually care about fighting a militarized police force and opposing authoritarianism way more than I care about making a tech CEO fall off a treadmill. The city of London is wonderfully realized - take it from a Londoner, this is an amazing achievement. The different parts of the city *feel* right, and I love driving around it. 

Yes, the dialogue is janky and not as smooth as a fully-scripted story with a single protagonist would have been. But I like building my team, and care about them enough that I was really nervous when my favorite hacker almost got killed (you MUST play this game on hard with permadeath for a proper experience - it is extremely easy in any case and simply trivial on lower difficulties). And the gameplay is streamlined in such a way that you can move from gunplay to melee combat to hacking very smoothly, without tons of superfluous abilities. Some people will miss a couple of favorite abilities from past games, but in my view this entry feels much better to play than the first two, and that trade-off is worth it.

So this is a good game. If you judge it on its own merits, I think it's easily the most compelling of the trilogy. And, even better, it came free with my 3080 and looks gorgeous - what's not to like?",Text,2020-10-30 07:30:59

I honestly am struggling to like Legions,2,jl1xv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl1xv6/i_honestly_am_struggling_to_like_legions/,0,1604110128.0,potatohead657,"I came with a very positive mindset. I am trying really hard to only focus on the positive but I can’t seem to like it. The story is so forgettable, even mid mission it fails to grab my attention that I end up skipping cutscenes. 

And the dialogue, oh lord the dialogue. The cheesiness is beyond measure. And people say WD2 was bad. Speaking of which, it somehow plays and handles imho better than WD3, even looks better tbh. 

Too unpolished and the characters are no way near likeable. Especially when they speak. Sounds like Power Rangers writers wrote the script; no one speaks like that. The tech and gimmicks in-game are too futuristic that they break logic and immersion and it’s just underwhelming.

I’m gonna keep pushing through it hopefully it gets better, but I’m no longer as optimistic that it would impress.
I’m apprehensive about their next titles, Valhalla and Fra Cry...

Watch Dogs: Legion's awful 1080p PC visuals + advice to work around it,1,jl84y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl84y6/watch_dogs_legions_awful_1080p_pc_visuals_advice/,1,1604130783.0,NevarcBB,"When I first booted Legion up I was honestly baffled at just how muddy and awful it looked, combined with performance that didn't exactly impress. Something about this game's TAA both fails to get rid of aliasing while still muddying a huge amount of detail in the image. Turns out this problem mainly exists at 1080p, with the TAA doing its job much more effectively at higher resolutions. This is unlike Ubisoft's recent AC games, which have a TAA solution that works effectively at both 1080p and 4k.

My advice to anyone with a 1080p monitor is to attempt some supersampling with Nvidia DSR, and tune it to find a good balance between performance and visuals. If you have an RTX card you can even turn on DLSS to get your performance back, and improve the visuals massively pretty much for free.

Here's the steps to do so:

1. Open Nvidia Control Panel, and under global settings enable 4.00x under ""DSR - Factors"", and set ""DSR - Smoothness"" to 0%. Hit apply then launch the game.
2. In Watch Dogs Legion, you'll now have 3840x2160 as a resolution option. Turn that on.
3. If you have an RTX card, turn on DLSS. Test out all of the options find the best balance between performance and visuals. If you don't have an RTX card, instead use the ""Temporal Upscaling"" slider to experiment with different render resolutions until you find the best visuals/performance balance.

I know this isn't the best solution, and won't help people who are struggling to even run the game to begin with. I will say though to test this out even if the game isn't running perfectly smoothly for you at 1080p. Reason being is that the performance issues in this game are mostly CPU bound, and thus not tied to the game's resolution anyway.",Text,2020-10-31 03:53:03

Not just that but stealth isn't a cake walk anymore. its not a instant kill with melee, and to get a decent far range weapon, a certain character is required. Last but not least, the new fighting game mechanic is great fun. It is difficult but not in a sense that you can't overcome your enemy.

So the story to me seems pretty out there in terms that it's spread out really far in this City. This definitely feels different in terms of gameplay because you are not just one Protagonist, but the Protagonist is DedSec and you only play as one of many operatives you recruit. It's really hard to invest in a single DedSec character because it doesn't hold a single amount of abilities you can build from ground up. Each person you recruit has a specific perk and ability. I find this kind-of lack luster in terms of Character development because I can't really decide a favorite to use. Some better than others but I feel as though I am missing out on caring for some of them. If they die I just easily replace them. The lack in characters and dialog is a bit off putting. Voice Actors for different characters is definitely a plus to make up for that but it doesn't shine as good as it should. Story is 2/5

**Gameplay**

The feeling of smashing and round house kicking people in the face feels great. However the overall walking or running around feels a bit arcadeish, real jank for lack of a better word. In terms of movement both character and vehicles I'd say it was a bit lazy in these parts. The many collections (especially the tech points) are arguably the most tedious thing in this game. To advance or even feel to make a difference depends heavily on collecting items and unlocking stuff for DedSec. Gameplay is 3/5

**World and Environment**

London England is a magnificent place. I really enjoy sight seeing this place because for one, it really does resemble London in a lot of ways. The buildings, bridges and historical areas really brings out the world being alive. AI in this game is a bit dumb though. Enemies are really stupid and don't really react to the player and traffic is  antonymous. Graphics are really good as well the dynamic weather reaction to cars and pedestrians. HDR10 works well here in the game. World and Environment is 4/5

**Sound and Dialog**

Sound is great, I really enjoy the choices of Music put into the game. Horns on Vehicles are strange, some of the horns for certain vehicles don't really add up. Gun fights and dynamic weather sounds are real spot on. Dialog makes each person unique with their own personality, however it feels like they are just reading from a script which comes off as less care for them and their character. Sound and Dialog 3/5

**Conclusion**

WD Legion was delayed a couple times so that they worked tirelessly to make sure the game was in great condition for the player. I think the game can be fun, but a lot of the elements before Legion seemed to have been stripped away which was vital for its charm and Identity. This feels more so like a spinoff that was a really great concept on paper but the Execution of it wasn't really up to snuff. That feeling of why we fell in love of the series has disappeared from this title. Most of the time I ask myself ""why I am doing this? How does this help the cause?"" It is but a revenge plot to me instead of just a resistance. 

I'll keep playing this game because it is WD and I love this series but I feel as though it is a bit underwhelming, the feeling from the last 2 WDs just seemed to have fade away. 

My final personal score is 3.5/5",Text,2020-10-30 12:49:19

However, I'm very pleasantly surprised by how it functions and it's strengths and weaknesses.

When I play WD2, I usually 'finish' areas by remaining outside and using the drones/cameras heavily, this is the gameplay experience that I loved most (even in WD1 I would attempt to do as much as I can before stepping a foot in the premises, but it was much more limited). 

In WD3 I started playing that way, heavily relying on the spider-bot, and quickly recruiting a drone specialist that also has a handy flying drone. But when I recruited an Albion officer (very early on) I was just amazed by how enjoyable the Hitman like gameplay in Legion is!

Walking around a hostile area (without the ability to take cover), distracting enemies that are about to spot you with a quick hack, cloaking for a couple of seconds to bypass a heavily guarded entrance and taking out isolated enemies is just so graceful and satisfying - It really changes the pace of the gameplay.

I guess I'm kinda rambling. I just really like this hacking+hitmanlike combination.",Text,2020-10-29 23:33:40

But when I'm not playing as these skilled people, they are just walking around or sitting in the safe house. 

I would like to make them, well...more useful when not playing as them. 


Imagine a list. 

A list were you chose up to 5 people. 
And a call button in the radial menu. 

Some examples:

* Smugglers for weapon delivery.
* Drivers when you need to get out of a tough situation.
* Bodyguard if you need backup.
* Hitman for taking out targets ( like in Ghost recon, except you only get three targets) 
* Drug dealers for... Well, drugs.


You get what I mean. 

It would make them so much more relevant to the game.

And it would actuly make you experiment more during missions.


Also, I don't like the weapon restrictions at all.

It would be better to just make it so everyone can use every weapon available.

But...

Those with the weapon already equipped, class or just what their background is ( MI5, Veteran, Mercenary ) have more experience with them, so they are more proficient with its use, like accuracy and ammo management.


Also, can we have ""class"" specific repeatable missions? 

* Hitman, with targets to kill. 
* Drivers with people to drive. 
* Again...drug dealers for dealing drugs. 

The mission structures can be lazy, I don't care. 
I just know I want them.

Legion: Horrible voice acting!,0,jl637c,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl637c/legion_horrible_voice_acting/,8,1604123605.0,Nukeacitrus,"So I've played for about an hour, and I got two crew members so far, both female and both with horrible voices. The first one has a bit of a slavic accent, which is fine, I enjoy variety, but the voice lacks any kind of emotion or believability, sounding like she's nervously reading from a script whenever she speaks, the voice stilted and forced. I'm unsure of the second ones accent, but that voice also makes me cringe whenever I hear it, equally bad as the first one.

In conversations, they'll say things like ""I tracked someone and walked into a trash bin. Not very deadsec"" and the other one will go ""No, that was not good."", both sounding like they're aliens trying to mimic human speech. I can't understand how whoever gave them directions passed this and thought these takes were good. I'd hate to hear how the rejected ones sounds!

To be clear, I'm not mad at them having accents, this isn't about them not sounding ""British"", but they just sound so uninvested and dull whenver they open their mouths.  I guess I could get used to it, and I'm aware that some people actually sounds like that IRL, but man... It's horrible. Hopefully I just got unlucky.  


EDIT: So I've been told that they used a AI to tune the voices to make them sound unique. Guess I really did get unlucky! I know two members who'll be going into some dangerous missions soon enough....",Text,2020-10-31 01:53:25

Oversold and Under-Delivered,7,jkvi8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkvi8d/oversold_and_underdelivered/,9,1604088357.0,icGutta,"I’d like to start by saying that this in no way is a hate post. There’s isn’t much to hate with Watch Dogs Legion. But, with that being said... there aren’t many things to love either. 

WD Legion is very underwhelming imo. Starting with the many missing features that were prevalent in both of the previous games. Eavesdropping on phone calls, spying on texts, traffic cam hacks, emps. Hell, I could even say I miss the way Marcus would flip periodically while free running in WD2. I could go on but why bother.. majority of the cool stuff i enjoyed from the past is just gone.

The lack of a main protagonist leaves me feeling like I’m actually taking orders from a computer and not playing as someone whom is taking orders from a computer. It feels like I’m just here checking tasks off a list. Don’t get me wrong, swapping from character to character is a cool feature and I know we were told we could recruit and play as any NPC. However, what we weren’t told was that meant not being able to upgrade our favorites and unlock additional abilities to bolster whatever they started with. That, in combination with the fact that every character is so limited it almost forces you to swap between characters if you want to experience a different style of play and that is killing the immersion for me. I’ve had 4 of my favorite operatives die so far and can say I just didn’t care after the first because I can find some guy on the street with the same abilities. The sheer lack of investment i have in the characters takes away a major piece of what this game could have been imo. I feel as though this game should have had a primary protagonist and the recruiting should have been an addition to his or her’s story. As it is there just isn’t any depth to any of the playable characters or any backstory behind any of them in my legion aside from the script on their resume.

I had high hopes but so far I am a little disappointed in this game. It just doesn’t feel like a finished product.",Text,2020-10-30 16:05:57

Electro-fist not working properly ?,2,jl10gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl10gj/electrofist_not_working_properly/,6,1604107220.0,OverThanVeins,"As stated in the title, I think the Electro-fist might be bugged or maybe I'm just missing something.

I started the game, recruited an albion officer pretty fast, went for the electro-fist very early aswell 'cause it just seemed the way I wanted to play the game. I really liked the baton from Albion recruits so I haven't changed my character ever since, and really enjoyed the electro-fist itself too.

But sometimes, I can't use it. It just doesn't work. It's not in cooldown, but for some reason I just can't use it. Is there something that prevents you from using it in red areas ? 'Cause I think that's where it happened everytimes, and yet I'm pretty sure I've been able to use it sometimes. Or maybe only Albion red zones ? I really couldn't say, and I just can't find anything about gadgets restrictions.

Edit: Actually, it's happening to me right now, I tried to switch to the spiderbot and I just can't use the spiderbot either. My gadget just doesn't work.

Edit 2: Well. It seems to be related to my hack being on toggle instead of hold. I just pressed the hack button and it debugged my gadget. Really don't know what happened there",Text,2020-10-30 21:20:20

You need the Deep profiler tech skill and save some random people on the street to recruits. Deep profile them in your team screen and you should see their schedule. If you select one of the schedule items you can investigate it and mark it on the map. If you do that and go to the marked spot on the map the game will offer to forward time to when that event in their schedule happens. This way you can change night to day and vice versa or set the time to when you know some special event or operative is roaming the streets .

Then he goes and calls it shit, the thing is yes it is another ubi game to a degree. He also shats on the voice acting. He did barely anything in the open world. Yes the hacking is dubbed down in the world, (traffic lights, sewers, calling cops) but he doesn’t praise the new hacks at all like cloak, spider bot, shroud. Which are new cool things to watch dogs, so in that sense wdl has better gameplay hacks then open world hacks. He also doesn’t go to mention how the gun variety and feel is improved over the previous games, which yeah he hasn’t played the others but still. He also doesn’t praise the driving which baffled me the driving feels like fucking butter lmao. Also he doesn’t act like the recruit anyone is cool or relevant, which it is yeah it has bad lip sink and voice acting, but the traits are cool the deep profiler is also really cool. It just seemed like he poked fun and shot it down because that’s what people like to watch I guess.

But this npc system  
oh fuck me.  
Playing as anyone is cool, and this special set of perks is also cool, but for ppl like me that like to customize their characters, BOTH ways-: looks and playstyle.  Its the worst.   
I want to have good loking character. okay i got it but i got shitty perks Boom i found good perks character but it looks like shit. ey i found one with both damn but its voise sounds like fuckin rubber duck downpitched and reverbed. Even when i found character with all what i want. I CANT EVEN SWAP THIS SHITTY TAEASER GUNS FOR NORMAL ONES XDDD  
Seriously they do nothing, and thats the biggest pain in the ass for me in this game. That you cant play like you want, you are grounded by having to play stupid RNG game with your MAIN character/characters. I want to have silenced pistolk that can kill like in first game but also want some perks for hack, and EVEN when i will find character with all this it will be probably looking or sounding like garbage. I want to play this game so much but i dont enjoy it more than 50% i guess. I hope they gonna change it at least a little in the future.

Something feels off.,73,jkfla4,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkfla4/something_feels_off/,96,1604024714.0,zaxwlyde,"EDIT: I elaborated more in the comments on a reply, so I will post those points at the bottom of this edit. 

Full disclosure: I am an absolute mega-fan of the Watch_Dogs series. When the first one caught a ton of flack I viciously defended it even amidst the true flaws it had, and I absolutely adored the second to bits. I've platinumed both titles and waited eagerly for Legion, diving in the moment that it arrived.

My issues with Legion do not in any way shape or form focus on the current state of the PC performance (I previously play WD1+2 on PS4 but am now on PC). The issues that I have stem from the fact something just feels... off. It feels incredibly oversimplified in a sense, like how Skyrim was to Oblivion. It feels like a portion of the hacking components were stripped clean and the challenge removed from them. 

They also removed traffic-light manipulation which was something I loved to dick around with, and on top of it... It just feels, floaty I guess? While I think the combat was improved for gunplay, I feel like everything else was somewhat stripped back from the refinement of Watch_Dogs 2. I knew Legion would be divisive based on the lack of a proper character-centric story with the way the recruitment system worked, but I feel that it's far more than just the story that we lost in the process of this title.

I'm still going to stick by playing it in an effort to get through the story that's there and because I genuinely adore the franchise, but I'll admit I'm somewhat disappointed in what we got.

POINTS I ADDED:

- Point acknowledged for traffic-lights, still stands as the removal of a feature that many people enjoyed.
- The entire game feels floaty. The weight of movement feels decreased and there is a quality degradation to free-running, especially in regards to individual animation and character rigging.
- The Tech Tree was over-simplified and to be honest feels like they stripped away most of the really cool tech elements to direct too much focus onto drone technology.
- >!The story feels jagged and out of place in multiple parts. For example, the opening was incredibly cinematic and felt absolutely brilliant, right after it you're suddenly thrust into this random character in London with little to no initial backstory outside of Zero-Day hurting DedSec and you need to find this base. This guy just suddenly after 6 months ups and joins DedSec at random with almost no subcontext.!<
- Driving feels way more chaotically floaty. It feels way too easy to control vehicles now, as if they're made of jelly practically. There's no weight to it, and in my opinion it ruined motorcycles in the game for me.
- They simplified the difficulty by making it far easier than before to hack cameras and gain viewpoints into other rooms.
- Degradation in AI quality, more times than not the AI can see me yet not trip their alarms, making stealth piss-easy with little to no challenge to it.",Text,2020-10-29 22:25:14

Suggestion: Further Customization,1,jl0jp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl0jp5/suggestion_further_customization/,1,1604105792.0,Horizone102,"Listed below are some of the areas I think are really worth looking into for more customization in the game for our operatives. 

Granted, I don't think having total control over customization would work because then it kind of defeats the purpose of the recruiting system.

- Hair. Nothing is worse having some of these goons look ridiculous and not being able to do anything about it. 

- Lock in outfits so that your operatives will be wearing the clothing you've picked out for them specifically so they can show up in the game world/cutscenes as you want them.

- Additional perks that are one-offs for a character when using them. These can range from being able to purchase their own fire arm to things like buying their own vehicle. Instead of being able to grant them to everyone and forcing the player to choose on a case by case basis, this would prevent operatives from essentially all being the same with these one-off perks.

- Face and voice sets. This might be pushing it but sometimes these voices don't match the characters face. At the least being able to change the face would make it far easier in customizing a character to your liking. So they won't break immersion when my stone cold killer starts talking like they just won the lottery with their oddly chipper demeanor. 

Just suggestions I'd like to see.
I'm sure some will disagree but these are just my own little pet peeves. Regardless, I'm having fun with the game and greatly enjoy the hunting for operatives that fit my tastes. Usually.. lol",Text,2020-10-30 20:56:32

Setting it HIGHER (50+, got mine at 75) actually does the opposite to what it says lmao. It decreases the Deadzone, giving the stick input more room to breathe and letting you make small adjustments easier.

Does anyone have any idea of how to fix this because I really want to play this game.😞

Btw i use ubisoft connect.",Text,2020-10-30 16:09:45

SUGGESTION: PLEASE Give us a way to listen to music outside of vehicles.,13,jknyit,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jknyit/suggestion_please_give_us_a_way_to_listen_to/,4,1604051838.0,JoshuaRAWR,"title. It's so fucking miserable to be roaming around somewhere, sneaking through a red zone and there's no music at all.Then there's getting into fist fights with people, no music at all, no 'ambient combat music' just the sound effects from the fists/melee weapons. \*BSH BSH BSH\* it's sad.

While you're at it, turn up the volume on the music that plays in vehicles as well, it's so damn quiet.",Text,2020-10-30 05:57:18

Can you disable the masks characters are wearing?,2,jkvejr,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkvejr/can_you_disable_the_masks_characters_are_wearing/,3,1604087909.0,Nino_Chaosdrache,"In every gameplay video I've watched so far, the characters start wearing masks if they seem to be in combat or in a mission area and I would like to know, if you can turn this off, so that they don't wear any masks at all.

I ask, because the masks look rather silly to me and I would like to play the game in a more serious way, similar to how WD1 was.",Text,2020-10-30 15:58:29

I triggered a turret but was on top of a skyscraper and on my lift drone but couldn't take off quick enough. Some how something threw grenades all the way to the top of the skyscraper and killed him. I turned off the console before his dead body even hit the ground in a failed attempt to stop the game from saving. 

My guy was awesome, he had been through a lot and had amazing voice acting. He looked like a total badass and even already had sweet clothes on when I picked him from the initial set in the beginning. 

You will be missed, Rogan. You will be missed. 😥
