Hello DedSec members! We’re on the eve of Watch Dogs: Legion’s global launch and [many regions have now begun to unlock the game](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/watch-dogs/legion/news-updates/30fdWwcvWlw3fBc3hKJXjy/everything-you-need-to-know-about-watch-dogs-legions-launch), so it’s high time for us to reiterate some important rules. 

Firstly we’d like to welcome /u/Treviso to the mod team, who joins us both on the subreddit and discord. You may recognize him as the organizer of the recent WD Marathon. Please give him a warm welcome :)

###SPOILER POLICY

Credit to /r/assassinscreed for the following spoiler writeup (we have made slight changes):

* If your post contains any spoilers always use [Spoiler] in the title, BUT DO NOT SPOIL ANYTHING IN THE TITLE ITSELF.
* You must spoiler-tag your posts and comments appropriately or they will be removed.
* Initially any untagged posts and comments spoiling WD Legion will be met with a 2-week ban. Troll accounts will be banned permanently.
* If the post already has [Spoiler] in its title, you do not need to hide any spoiler comments, as long as they are within the scope of the same topic.
* If you come across any untagged spoilers, report and downvote them. We will try to remove them as quickly as possible.

##Hiding Spoilers:

In comments and self-posts, using ```>!Spoilers Go Here!<``` will render the text illegible unless hovered/clicked. Example: >!Watch Dogs: Legion!<

##What Counts as a Spoiler?


Definition of a Spoiler: Revealing information that could ruin others' enjoyment of a game they haven't yet played. This includes revealing major elements of the plot or significant story-line events.

*Story events

*Side quest/easter egg content 

___
###Updated Removal Rules:

The following posts will be removed to prevent low-quality spam on the subreddit. Of course, posts can also still be removed at mod discretion if they break any of the other rules listed on the sub. 

* posting that you got your copy of the game 
* “can I run this on my PC”
* decide for me posts: (should I buy this game, should I get it on PS4 or PS5, which edition should I get etc)
* questions that you can easily google the answer to (“when is MP coming out” etc)
* pity posts (“I can’t get legion until x date but here’s a meme for you guys”)
* support-related questions: we will likely create 1 catch-all megathread for these/known issues, but please [submit a support ticket](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US) to ubisoft. Individual threads will be removed.

___
###Photo Posts

For now, to be extra vigilant re: spoilers since our bot cannot scan images, we will be turning on manual approval for any photo posts. This will be removed once things quiet down a bit, but for now it allows us to manage potential image spoilers more easily. 

___
###Feedback

We are happy to hear any feedback you might have or suggestions to improve the subreddit. Please be patient with our mod team in these coming weeks; we're doing our best to keep things civil and spoiler-free for everyone's enjoyment, but we are also moderating the [official watchdogs discord](http://discord.gg/watchdogs) at the same time AND trying to play the game :)",Text

Many people are missing the entire point of the recruitment system and other choices in Legion (long read),393,jl0o3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl0o3i/many_people_are_missing_the_entire_point_of_the/,154,1604106162.0,CapeManJohnny,"Disclaimer: This is a video game that we each paid for in one way or another, and we're all allowed to play it exactly how we want, and have whatever feelings about it that we want. This is strictly my opinion on why the recruitment system works perfectly, and why Ubisoft's experiment with player choice has been a resounding success.

Most people would agree that Ubisoft tried some pretty experimental stuff with Legion, but I don't think that the recruitment system is the most experimental or unique, I think it's the amount of **player agency** that we've been given.  This entire game seems to be a subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) statement on **freedom** and **choice**.

I've spent the last hour reading this sub, and half the posts seem to be complaining about various things, some seem understandable (stability issues on pc, big missing hacks from the others games \[blackout comes to mind\]), and some seem far less understandable (whining because the menu isn't presented as a phone anymore, not being able to read NPC's texts), but one of the big recurring themes seems to be that a lot of players don't enjoy the fact that this game doesn't give you a written backstory for the operators, and that being able to play as anyone is leaving them feeling like none of the operators matter because there is no personal investment in them.

If we had certain operators or recruit-able companions that had large, drawn out backstories and motivations for joining DeadSec, it would quickly force the recruitment system into the same ""**this was cool for 5 minutes, now I'll never think of it again until 3 years from now when it's not part of the next game and I'll complain that it was a series-defining feature that is completely irreplaceable and it's now ruined because of its omission**"" novelty status that we're experiencing right now with other flavor content. If we had a template ""hero"" character (or even characters), there would be absolutely zero reason to ever switch to anyone else, completely nullifying the recruitment mechanic as a whole.

This game just requires a touch of role playing or imagination to fully enjoy how it works, because Ubisoft is not spoon feeding us a novel-like story made into a game, instead they're giving us a build-your-own-adventure book and letting us come up with part of it on our own.  Instead of looking at my recruits as ""RNG characters with the same 4 recycled lines, no depth or back stories"" -(stolen from another reddit post complaining about the system), I've given them each their own backstory specific to how I envision it.

I'm looking at them as a bunch of normal people who are pulled into DeadSec because of abnormal conditions, not because they want to be fugitives/freedom fighters, but because they know something is wrong with London and feel compelled to do something about it. Inspector Finch in the V for Vendetta film makes a great analogue here. He's a law abiding citizen - who is literally a part of the system - that we get to watch transform throughout the film, not because he's ruled by vengeance like V, or (at risk of drastically over-simplifying her motives)because his attachment to V like Evie, but simply because he knows that what's happening is *wrong*.

My construction worker is just a blue collar guy who knows what's going on is wrong. He doesn't need to have a huge life-spanning backstory on why he's jaded at the world, and will risk his life to change it, because he isn't  - he's just a working man who is tired of going to work and seeing his fellow Londoners being brutalized by this militarized police force. He doesn't want to die, he doesn't want to go to prison, or be kidnapped off the street - he just wants to see London be free again.

My professional hitman? She's completely different, but similar enough in the ways that matter.  She's lived her life as an assassin, working for the highest bidder and not giving two fucks about much else, until Albion came along.  She doesn't have to be a saint to know that what's happening is simply wrong. She understands that even though she's spent her life being a butcher, she doesn't like the way her country is headed - and she sees that people without her abilities are rising up to do something about it, so perhaps she should.

And it goes on for every one of my team members. As soon as someone joins, I ask myself what would compel me if I was in their position - and run with that. We do the same thing with certain characters in books.  I think a good example here is Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series.  We're given small tidbits of Dumbledore's past over the series, however we're never given the same insight into his motivations as we are characters like Harry or Ron. Instead we're given some building blocks but allowed to fill in the space between them. That's all I'm doing with my operatives in the game, I'm taking what I was given about them, and filling in the empty space, which has led me to care about them. I'm playing with perma-death enabled, and I find myself afraid when situations escalate far more than I intended, for my character's life.

&#x200B;

The same concept of Ubisoft intentionally leaving in things that could easily be described as overpowered, once again is a result of giving us more freedom than traditional games.  The cargo drone is a perfect example here. I've seen several posts talking about how it's overpowered, yet we're completely given the option on when to use it, outside of the **very** few missions requiring us to move items with it.  Riding around on it can essentially break every outdoor encounter, allowing you to skip vast swathes of restricted zones, and go straight towards your goal - but only if you want it to.  I found myself using it too much yesterday, so I restricted myself to only using it when exploring or hunting for collectibles. Same thing with the spiderbot infiltrator.  I used it for the first several missions and realized that by doing so, I was making the perma-death setting pointless - as I was never actually risking my operators. I was hovering over the area in a cargo drone, dropping my spider as close as I could to the goal, and using it to finish the objective. If it died, I'd simply wait for the cooldown timer to reset, and do it again.  So now I'm going to limit myself to specific characters using it like the drone controller and hacker in my team.

It's completely fair to say that you don't enjoy the amount of choice that you've been given, or you think they could have done something differently - but I don't think it's fair to ridicule the choices made by Ubisoft without at least recognizing that they are giving us a monumental amount of freedom in a narrative-driven game, the likes of which is often only found in sandbox settings.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I think Ubisoft made a conscious decision to allow us more **freedom of choice** in this game than any other WatchDog game (and perhaps any other open world game as a whole) and it seems that a lot of people are missing that. They're looking at the lack of scripted backstories for our operatives as laziness by the developers, instead of a blank slate on which they can write their own backstory and personalities for their team members - and I think that's missing the amazing opportunity that this game is giving.

Recruiting a Hitman in Watch Dogs Legion,211,jl27g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl27g6/recruiting_a_hitman_in_watch_dogs_legion/,45,1604110995.0,TRICKYTOMSTER,"There have been a lot of people asking how and where to recruit Hitmen. I recently created a guide on how to recruit a spy and a lot of people found it very helpful. A lot of you requested for me to create one for Hitmen. So here it is.

The Hitman is a skilled operative that has 3 default skills. 1. Desert Eagle + G36 - The hitman comes equipped with a pretty beefy arsenal. The desert eagle packs a punch against enemies and the G36 is great at holding off bad guys and assaulting holdouts. 2. Gunkata - this trait allows for instant takedowns with a gun. To perform it when fighting someone pull out your gun and hit them and the Hitman will instantly take care of the trash. 3. Combat Roll - this trait allows for the Hitman to roll away out of combat by double-pressing the jump button.

However, as with the spy, you can find Hitmen with a fourth trait.  These can range from being old and fragile, to being physically fit and able to take more damage. It is basically just RNG.

**DISCLAIMER:** You have to have completed the Reporting for Duty mission in order to begin spawning skilled operatives. This mission early on in the game and specifically it is when permadeath sets in. 

**The first location** is in the City of Westminster borough near Brewer St. station. As you walk out of the station immediately walk across the street into the ally on the right. If you travel here at night you will have the chance of encountering a Hitman completing a job. Don't approach them instantly wait until they have killed their target. Because if you kill them they will hate DedSec and deny your attempt at recruiting them. After they killed their target save them to recruits and then open the deep profiler and then begin recruiting them. Hitmen spawn mostly during night 20:00 - 04:00.

&#x200B;

[Location 1 - City of Westminster next to Brewer Street 20:00 - 04:00 \(Night\)](https://preview.redd.it/cwpkvjuwx9w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f096a3c90a0f1fec0b60bddf3908a8caafd833e)

&#x200B;

**The second location** is near the bare knuckle boxing arena in Camden. At the North of the map in the borough of Camden neat the fist icon. If you travel to the bare knuckle boxing arena in Camden Town at night then you have a chance to find a Hitman. With this location, they can either be standing around or completing a job. This location tends to be best at night. 23:00 - 04:00. Credit - u/signguy21

&#x200B;

[ Location 2 - Camden in Camden Town around the Bare Knuckle Boxing Arena 23:00 - 04:00 \(Night\)](https://preview.redd.it/1skdk334y9w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bca2a5d854cad2e63febf06e016e6eea51298ca)

&#x200B;

**The third location** is in China Town. In the City of Westminster travel towards Brewer St. Just South, East of the station you should find China Town. Walk down the main avenue and you should find a Hitman either just finishing completing a job or standing against a wall smoking. Go up to them and add them to your recruits. Remember to wait until they have done their job. This location I believe works at any time. I have found videos and Reddit posts saying this location has worked both during the day and at night. So for the moment, I'm saying that this is a permanent spawn no matter the time and just RNG if they show up.

&#x200B;

[ Location 3 - City of Westminster in China Town \(Any-time\)](https://preview.redd.it/d57s7739y9w51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c389e026033fa4810f5c1d6ee25a3af88a0134bf)

Hopefully this helps anyone looking to get a Hitman operative the most action-packed operative. I will be updating this post so please comment any other locations you guys have found.

Also, if you are looking to get a Spy I have made a guide for that as well.

Recruiting a Spy in Watch Dogs Legion,343,jkvr91,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkvr91/recruiting_a_spy_in_watch_dogs_legion/,83,1604089442.0,TRICKYTOMSTER,"A lot of people have been asking where to recruit a Spy. From the time I have spent looking, I have managed to find 6 spots that almost guarantee a Spy to spawn. Each at different times. (With the help of some Redditors)

The spy is a skilled operative that has 3 default skills. 1. P9 Silenced - A suppressed P9 that can easily take down most enemies with one shot to the head. 2. Spy Watch - A unique skill tailored to the spy that when activated can jam enemy weapons for a period of time allowing for a hard-hitting takedown or a quick getaway. And 3. A Spy Car - A classic vehicle on-demand with the ability to launch missiles and turn invisible for a short amount of time allowing you to escape your pursuers.

However, if you get lucky you could find a spy with a fourth trait. These can range from being old and fragile, to being physically fit and able to take more damage. It is basically just RNG.

**DISCLAIMER:** You have to have completed the Reporting for Duty mission in order to begin spawning skilled operatives. This mission early on in the game and specifically it is when permadeath sets in.

**The first** **location** is near Westminster Bridge. On the south side of the bridge in Lambeth, head towards the County Hall. Go through the archway towards a giant digital clock that shows time in different time zones. On the left of the reception doors you should find a spy, I've found they tend to spawn around 17:00 to 23:00, usually in the evenings.

&#x200B;

**The second** **location** is near the Tower of London. It is right at the bottom right-hand corner of the City of London borough. Head towards the tourist entrance to the Tower and turn around to face east. Towards the side road. Hopefully, you should find yourself a spy and his car (where the guy in red is standing, who is a spy I have already recruited. These guys tend to spawn around 23:00 to 04:00 usually quite late a night.

**The third location** is at and around the Tower Hotel building. Head over to the Tower Hamlets borough and right next to the North exit of Tower Bridge you should find the MI5/6 building. The Spy will spawn in the parking lot opposite the burger food shop. Again next to their car. However, also with the location, Spies can be found walking around the building on the street. The last time I visited here, I found 2 Spies. One in the default spawn position and one that just happened to be walking near the building. This Spy tends to spawn in the afternoon. Around 12:00 to 19:00. In the image I collected for this post I managed to find one at 18:00.

**The fourth location** is at the Caromont Hotel in the City of London borough. Towards the bottom right of the borough just to the right of London Bridge you should find the Caromont Hotel. Head towards the parking at the entrance to the hotel and you should find a Spy by their vehicle. I found one here at midnight. So I assume this is a night time spawn. Around 19:00 - 04:00 (Night).

**The fifth location** is at the MI6 building. It is right along with the south edge of Lambeth next to the river Thames. Head towards the front of the building (street side) so you are staring at the entrance. On your right, you should find an ally. Head into the ally and you should find a spy next to their vehicle. Redditors have commented that they could appear both during the afternoon and night time. Credit - u/Shizzlick and u/EH_Sparky

**The sixth location** is in the Big Ben car park. In the borough, City of Westminster near the Big Ben. If you fast travel to Westminster station, grab a car or run around to the south side of Big Ben. There you will find a car park. In the car park in the afternoon, you should find a spy.

Hope this helps people recruit arguably the best operative in the game for stealth.

Also, for those of you asking I have just posted a Hitman guide as well.

Anyone else feel that every feature in Legion is kinda 75% done/good?,33,jl9i1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl9i1a/anyone_else_feel_that_every_feature_in_legion_is/,22,1604135855.0,Tensor3,"Maybe I'm just being too picky, but it feels like everything is just a bit off to me. From graphics to gameplay to UI, everything feels a bit half-assed. They seem to have maximized quantity over everything.

Gameplay: All characters the same. Shooting has a weird diagonal/sideways recoil.  Only one ""ability"" and most don't really do anything unique. I can't tell when it saves and it constantly loses progress. Too many pointless recruits everywhere and not enough direction to anything. Ammo is apparently universal to every gun, everyone gets the same gun, and I cannot pick up equipment from enemies. Hacking and the ""puzzles"" are overly simplistic, at a toddler level. Everything has the same hacking option and hacking never seems to do anything interesting or unique. The world is supposed to be ""dystopian"", but everything seems too clean, well-organized, wealthy, and smoothly-running, and yet no one notices if I run around destroying/stealing everything. Dialog is corny, voice acting subpar, and story underwhelming. Boring missions, repetitive gameplay. Melee combat is pretty terrible. No shop interiors.

UI: There is no indication if mission objectives are below/above me or inside/outside. No distance to objective. The objective descriptions seem vague. I can't tell what my HP is (I know how this style of HP works, but this implementation of it seems unclear) and it seems to fully heal almost instantly. I get popups to ""ctrl"" to hide on objects all the time, but inconsistently. Auto-driving doesn't seem to go to my objective and doesn't let me choose when/where to turn. Lots of time wasted trying to get to the next pointless repetitive thing because of poor UI.

Graphics: Lighting bugs. The water looks like colorless, detail-less, melted plastic with ray tracing--worst I've ever seen in a game. The textures of trees and bushes are blurry, very low resolution. The puddles are mirrors and everywhere at all times. The cars in unlit tunnels are shiny lit up mirror monsters. Some objects have insane detail, while others have none. Everything concrete (benches, walls) is just a flat, pristine concrete tiling texture with no marks or discoloration or nicks or different edges or anything. Performance is awful. Graphics don't feel like they fit together right somehow. Very repetitive assets; all the cars at the same.",Text

So this has happened twice, once before and after the updates. With the Ultimate edition you get those three additional operatives. I've been playing as one of the three Ultimate Edition Operatives, they then die, obviously the rules of Ironman are that when an operative dies you lose them forever, so, it sucks, but it makes the lives of the people a bit more meaningful, at least to me. It also makes me pay very special attention to who I would like to use for a mission in order to avoid someone dying if I pick the wrong person.

Anyway I like playing as Gabriel Isa, mainly for his MP5 Silenced. Anyway, He died while I went AFK to make coffee yesterday, stupid, I know, but I thought I was in a safe place when I obviously wasn't.

So he gets removed from the game, then a bit later on I log in and I look to change operatives and it says ""Gabriel Isa - New Operative"", I thought that was weird, so I kept playing. I felt like it worked out given that he died because I went AFK.

Anyway that brings me to an hour ago, I'm trying to beat the community challenge for the week (Yeah, thats not going to happen, in two days I think we've done less than 2% of the total, I doubt we will do the next 98% in 5 days, but why not try).

So I'm blasting the Albion guys trying to get a level 5 wanted level, run out of Amo, Gabriel gets roasted. Then my game freezes, I reset, low and behold the dude is in my team as a new Operative again.

I think the problem is that I log into the game and the game says to itself ""Ok, this is an Ultimate edition, so they get the three special operatives, they currently have 2, so I will provide the third one they got with their edition"" and then hands me whoever I've lost.

The problem with this is, now I'm not really doing Ironman am I, because you lose the game if all the Operatives die, but they can't all die if they keep resurrecting them. I mean I'm grateful I didn't lose my favourite character but it entire undermines why I selected Ironman in the first place which was to really feel the pain of my fuck ups.

Legion is fun but horribly under developed,415,jkoi6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkoi6n/legion_is_fun_but_horribly_under_developed/,345,1604053796.0,TonytehGreat,"Legion's a complete downgrade from 2 and feels way too loose with the controls, movement, and combat. The hideouts are fun to run through but taking out guards and defenses is way too easy right off the bat. The map is ok but all it has is objectives and collectibles scattered, not really anything worth exploring at all. Visually it's not anything impressive and the removal of stuff like mass hacks, vehicles, etc and even minor stuff like the phone menus and music player shows how much more couldve been worked on. Having fun atm because it's not a god awful game by any means but I'm probably not alone in being very disappointed. Hopefully ubi doesnt turn wd4 into shovelware and hope the title is enough to make up for its long list of shortcomings like Legion.

Honestly feels like most if not all Ubisoft games are taking huge leaps in the wrong directions

So far in Legion, however, these options have been only tied to recruiting specific characters.

My honest review after a few hours of legion (a first impressions of sorts),20,jkygv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkygv3/my_honest_review_after_a_few_hours_of_legion_a/,7,1604099215.0,the-reddit-user22,"This post is for people who are curious on other people thoughts on the game (of course). 

A couple years ago I got Watch Dogs 2 and while I didn’t think it was the best game ever, I thought it was a lot of fun and really enjoyed the concepts presented. I personally gave it an 8/10 (other games I’d rate 8/10 are dead cells, modern no mans sky, and rainbow six siege) as besides the bugs and the story being so-so it was really fun. Now legion has come out and of course I was eager to see what was next for watch dogs and while I wouldn’t say they hit it out of the park, I definitely think they made something kinda special.

I’m sure anyone on this sub already knows the deal with watchdogs legion so let’s get straight to the reviewing. First the graphics. Not gonna blow your mind but they certainly are far from bad. Don’t expect it to be better than 2 though, I’d say legion is more consistent with its graphics but it doesn’t reach some of the heights that 2 does. Textures are good besides some of the fire effects and stuff (like 2) overall you shouldn’t be bothered much by it. Character models are hit or miss. Some look good while others look like mass effect andromeda.

Story and voice acting is eh. Bagley is surprisingly enjoyable and probably my favorite character but the main story itself isn’t very strong even by Ubisoft standards but that’s for a reason. It’s not bad but I personally haven’t gained anything from it so far and I feel like I would have been the same had I just skipped cutscenes so far as a lot of exposition is already given after the cutscene ends. The play as anyone system doesn’t help either, it’s decent but isn’t gonna give you the same kind of quality as you would with one protagonist.

However I’m sure people expected this, what people really wanna know is how is the gameplay? Well (in my opinion) it’s an absolute blast. I have stated multiple times on this sub that it seems they ditched a lot of the random goofy stuff for more substance to the gameplay and while whether you like that or not is up to you, to me it has worked to insanely great effect. The world itself is extremely alive thanks to the NPCs and the systems in them and how they interact. In combat and stuff they aren’t the smartest but they certainly do enough damage on hard mode to be somewhat formidable (though I turned off aim assist so that could be a problem). But in the world you can see some pretty neat stuff and that is added based on the character you play as. I find it really cool how playing as an Albion guard clan Kelly members will push me around, I love when you arrest someone nearby Albion guards will guard the person (though I think you can’t let them see you do it or else it counts as an execution). There’s just small stuff like that that can pop out from the world that is just so cool. Combat here is better than the other 2 games like combined. The melee system is perfect for this kind of thing as it’s not so complicated you can get lost in it but it’s more complex than just pressing x. Gunplay is also pretty good and mission structure added on with the play as anyone is really fun. Recruiting people as well is also just loads of fun and feels like going on a separate quest line. I got so deep in it that I hadn’t attacked a single stronghold on my own as I was so deep in doing missions for possible recruits.

The open world is pretty standard. I’d say the strengths with this one is the enemy territory design as all the places to attach are pretty fun and interesting. There aren’t shop interiors but there are plenty of interiors throughout the open world that you can enter freely and just mess around in. And the recruitment system allows these interiors to actually have a lot more substance than 2. In 2 almost all interiors were locked behind missions, only like the entrance, or small shops. In legion there are legitimate places like full on buildings that you can freely go into and actually have substance to them when you need to do missions. I was so happy when I found out that you could enter the shard at any time and wasn’t some big raid mission. Besides the enemy bases though, there isn’t as much fun little things here as there is in 2. Everything here serves more purpose than just messing around and that’s evident through the nature of them. Darts and keep up And bare knuckle boxing are all things to do for recruitment missions. I personally like the approach of having a lot of things serve purpose but it is kinda sad that there isn’t as many thing to just mess with.

Hacking has been dumbed down sort of. I feel the hacking in itself has way better usage in this game but it’s only better usage of the basic hacks you already have seen. There isn’t really anything new besides the deep profiler and a lot of hacks have been removed like calling gangs or cops on people or exploding cars while they are chasing you. 

I haven’t really experienced any glitches or anything major Just the usual buggy AI every now and then

In summary so far legion has a lot more bite than bark compared to its previous entries. Unfortunately it abandons a lot of the more sandboxy open world fun activities and trades it for a different kind of experience with a lot more substance. It has some rough voice acting bits and the story is alright, but the gameplay systems are so entertaining that I can’t help but enjoy it. I have heard many technical problems though and again there are things here that will bother people as it’s a lot less of a traditional watch dogs. 

Personally I rate it an 8.5/10 it’s better than 2 but not by a humongous amount. I could definitely still see people going back to 2 every now and again but personally I think this one has a lot more to it that I enjoy.",Text

It would be cool if you could recruit Sarah Lincoln as a special member of Parliament operative and also Danny and Ro could have outfits for getting into Albion and Clan Kelley restricted areas respectively (though I doubt it because of the way things went at the end of the novel.

My main gripe is with the NPC voices. All the white males I have recruited have the same, posh Eton voice whilst all the black male operatives I have or even black male NPCs that I have come across are Jamaican. It just feels like a crude caricature. 

The matching of voices to personalities is also terrible - I have a construction site worker who speaks as if she were in the Royal Family and then an Albion captain with a distinctly European accent - no issue there, barring the fact that Europeans are persona non grata particularly where Albion is concerned.

I was hoping that the extra 6 months would have really allowed them to flesh out the NPCs, and whilst it's undoubtedly improved there is still so much that needs tweaking. Which is a shame, because there are some awesome improvements in this entry (melee combat, driving).

Watch Dogs Legion Wish List,2,jlb2m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jlb2m7/watch_dogs_legion_wish_list/,3,1604142065.0,Peachrocks,"Just some things I'd personally like in the game. Feel free to add your own.

1. Levelling up inactive operatives

I know why this feature was removed. Levelling up a character and having them die after you invest in them but this could work in  a few ways. While your operatives are not on mission, you could train them up in a variety of ways so that they are more capable of competing with the better operatives. There might even be people you could recruit who would be better teachers. A tree of talents and things an operative could focus on would be sweet. 

Some specialists would still start fully or mostly trained, but it could be theoretically possible to get rookies 'close' to the standards of the specialists. Would still suck to lose them, but it wouldn't as costly in terms of time, grinding and effort if done right. Plus customizing the training of operatives 

2. Calling for back up from inactive operatives

Saw this one elsewhere and its a solid idea. Need a drone? A getaway? A distraction? A sniper? You can call for it. Granted game might need to be a bit harder or have some more difficult settings but it could be useful. 

3. Sniper rifles, both lethal and less lethal 

Dunno if I just haven't come across them yet (mostly wandering around looking at people to recruit for the giggles) but there are times where I want to act, but the target or usually targets are just too far away. In addition being able to change characters weapons up a bit should be a thing. 

4. Aesthetics

In general this could be improved.  The shops are a mess, I know some people miss walking in but in my case it's more a matter of not being able to find specifics as easily, especially when you see other characters wear things I want for my own. 

It's a pain going to each and every shop you come across and still not finding what you want. Plus some shops are way more common then others. I also know that there is a possibility of hair and facial hair changes being put in so there is that. 

Also on a person note and this one might sound odd, but I want my character to wield an umbrella. Either as a weapon/gadget or even just cosmetically. I spend a lot of time walking around, like I have one guy who I make out to be an recruiter/intelligence gatherer who silently helps people being bullied and gathers information and will do some ops if he can avoid getting his hands dirty and is usually the guy I send to talk to people. He wears a suit and tie so it just feels off whenever it rains. I like the rain personally but yeah just a very personal pet peeve. It was doable in Bully of all games and there's obviously animations for it, so let me do it :D.",Text

I realize the whole idea of the game is to have a team of many different experts and switch between them as the job requires, but it is kind of a bummer that there is no way to upgrade Operatives skills at all, which means you are basically forced to either use agents you gain from Borough disruption or to get lucky and find someone with decent skills out in the world.

-certain characters have different emotes on their wheel
- when handcuffing people you can pick them up and escort them places/ move them around.
- Fix the 1 star cops when you are driving as if you sit still they do literally nothing
- make the NPCs more tolerant of you when you are one of them like Albright guards not automatically attacking you if you arrest someone.

And of course a feature that I think could hugely boost this game
-statistical changes like in e3 2018 trailer.
Don’t get me wrong, the new system is amazing but I feel that the percentages would add a whole new layer of depth to the game. I feel like while it might be fun for the memes or stylistic reasons, but a lot of NPCs are just not at all worth recruiting. It’s cool that I can get a politician and get jail out time, but the barrister next to her will take the same amount of time to recruit and does the same thing plus more. Having statistical changes would help make choosing characters a lot better especially in scenarios like the construction workers where they only have one load out.

-Extra: break people out of prison after being arrested. I could have sword hearing this was in the game like 1,000 times but to my dismay I was unable to find and rescue my operatives after finding the station they were in. 

-extra 2: more random events. Felt that there wasn’t enough random stuff and events going on throughout the world. The world was certainly alive don’t get me wrong but I felt that more interaction could have beeb done like the scenario in the e3 2019 trailer.

Just feels very underwhelming, unpolished, and a bit boring in terms of narrative. Visuals also seem very dated and unpolished technically.

The controls feel clunky and heavy, like they needed more time to be polished, especially the driving. The driving feels delayed in terms of input response and just doesn't feel fun which is disappointing. Combat is okay with some cool melee sequences but again feels clunky and delayed. Audio doesn't always sync up with what's going on either.

As far as missions, they seem a bit stale so far. Nothing stands out as unique or fun. They've all been a bit samey. Also, due to the fact that you can play as anyone, it diminishes the narrative a bit, especially the voice acting. Feels more like an online game with a story tacked onto it. The aspect of playing as anyone is a cool concept, just hurts certain parts of the game.

Honestly, as of this point, I enjoyed WD1and 2 much more. They had a few extra things this game doesn't and had a more consistent. narrative.

* Yes, you can have a character permanently die but...so what? The security at the place you died is exactly the same, npc's aren't on high alert of reinforced after someone tried to break into their base.
* Mass murdering Albion or civilians does not make Deadsec hunted on sight or disliked by civilians. I'd love a mechanic where the more times you murder Albion, theirs a chance for them to send a squad to hunt your characters down.
* After gunning down Albion or Clan Kelly during a mission, their is usually no chase or pursuit after the mission. You just walk out of a certain perimeter like you did nothing.",Text

The system isnt bad at all, it just lacks dept because everyone is almost the same and the abilities arent that unique. The most important parts of the gameplay can be accessed with any character and all that makes them different from one another are secondary non essential skills and tech. And uniforms.

It is also worth noting that an Albion police car will ever show up to actually take them to any sort of facility.

The albion officer who is guarding the person will ocasionally make death threats towards them. They will also make sure the cuffs are on tight enough. Sometimes they will aim the gun at them, for no reason.

Legion is a significant downgrade from Watch Dogs 2,90,jkod9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkod9u/legion_is_a_significant_downgrade_from_watch_dogs/,73,1604053312.0,Queef-Elizabeth,"I  really hate feeling like a negative Nancy right now cause I'm sure there are some very appealing features in this game that make it a better experience than 2 for many people but I'm sorry, it is staggering to see how many features and mechanics have been omitted from previous games and this whole 'recruit anyone' system just does not feel worth it.

In just 6-8 hours of playtime in Legion, I have noticed the removal of:

\- Pop up phone menu

\- Car stealth

\- Move to cover button

\- Music finder or being able to listen to music outside of your car

\- Music playlists

\- Hacking options

\- Many shop interiors

\- a likeable protagonist

\- No more gang warfare

\- Citizens don't call or report you to the police if they witness you committing a crime

\- Car garage and customisation (although very mild in 2)

\- any effort put into free running

&#x200B;

On top of that, melee combat is a chore for the most part and just isn't fun with the operatives I've been given. Pressing square 3 times and then triangle doesn't make for engaging combat and I'd much prefer the one button attack 2 had. But Ubisoft had to forced in enemy health bars once again into their games so that enemies are damage sponges and it just takes me out a bit. The game also performs really poorly and is consistently buggy as I've had times where I got on a motorbike only to be flung 20 metres down the street, in the middle of a pursuit.

Something about this game feels off. I understand that some sequels remove features to make way for something new but this just feels like a total regression for the franchise. The recruitment feature is awesome in theory (and in practice at times) but it seems like it came at a cost of all the nice little immersive details that were in the previous games and imo, it doesn't work anywhere near as well as it should. Ironically, in their attempt at doing something unique with their property, Watch Dogs feels more generic than ever in the way the open world functions.

And one more thing, the lack of any protagonists (once again, while cool in theory) just doesn't work for me. If you're going to commit to something so daring, it has to be done perfectly and so far, the dialogue feels plainly robotic. It doesn't feel like two people having a conversation. It feels like 2 voice actors in a recording booth going through their lines. And on top of that, voices barely match the faces of the characters.

The game has its good sides, like the city of London being a breath of fresh air to explore and the effort being put into having every NPC become a player character with their own recruitment missions (although I foresee the missions becoming rather repetitive as the game goes on) but I'm having a hard time getting over the lack of neat features that gave the series some life in the past.

Are some of the features that I mentioned unlockable later in the game and I just haven't seen them? Have I missed anything?",Text

The game is rather quiet aswel. There's not much ambient noise for a massive city like London. Just very echoed like chatter from NPC's.

Legion is the First Watch Dogs I Have Really Enjoyed,58,jkpg5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkpg5p/legion_is_the_first_watch_dogs_i_have_really/,12,1604057459.0,CroftSpeaks,"You know when you read a bunch of takes and wonder whether you're playing the same game as everyone else? That's me right now, reading some of the super negative takes here. Legion is a great game. I played WD1 and liked it fine: I found the incongruity between the narrative and the gameplay to be jarring; I didn't like the main character, who I thought was just dull and a bad person; the world seemed grey and uninspiring to me; I thought the hacking, though genuinely new and interesting, was over-complicated and obtuse.

I got WD2 for free when they did the giveaway and played about half of it. I liked the colorful world, I thought it was more appropriate tonally than the first one, and I enjoyed some of the side characters. But I didn't feel the writing was strong (it wasn't as funny as it thought it was, which is really dangerous for a satirical work), and the story was a mishmash which just sort of lurched from one thing to another. The characters didn't feel connected to the world - too floaty, with the over-dramatic animations common to Ubisoft games of that period (ones which make you feel less connected to the action because of the disconnect between your button press and the result). I liked the range of ways you could interact with the world, but didn't find myself invested in the world enough to care to do them.

Legion, for me, hits the sweet spot between the two. It has a more serious and weighty storyline than 2, without being grim and humorless like 1. It tackles contemporary themes in a competent way, which makes it feel engaging: when I successfully liberate a borough of London from Albion, I feel GREAT because I actually care about fighting a militarized police force and opposing authoritarianism way more than I care about making a tech CEO fall off a treadmill. The city of London is wonderfully realized - take it from a Londoner, this is an amazing achievement. The different parts of the city *feel* right, and I love driving around it. 

Yes, the dialogue is janky and not as smooth as a fully-scripted story with a single protagonist would have been. But I like building my team, and care about them enough that I was really nervous when my favorite hacker almost got killed (you MUST play this game on hard with permadeath for a proper experience - it is extremely easy in any case and simply trivial on lower difficulties). And the gameplay is streamlined in such a way that you can move from gunplay to melee combat to hacking very smoothly, without tons of superfluous abilities. Some people will miss a couple of favorite abilities from past games, but in my view this entry feels much better to play than the first two, and that trade-off is worth it.

So this is a good game. If you judge it on its own merits, I think it's easily the most compelling of the trilogy. And, even better, it came free with my 3080 and looks gorgeous - what's not to like?",Text

Watch Dogs: Legion's awful 1080p PC visuals + advice to work around it,1,jl84y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl84y6/watch_dogs_legions_awful_1080p_pc_visuals_advice/,1,1604130783.0,NevarcBB,"When I first booted Legion up I was honestly baffled at just how muddy and awful it looked, combined with performance that didn't exactly impress. Something about this game's TAA both fails to get rid of aliasing while still muddying a huge amount of detail in the image. Turns out this problem mainly exists at 1080p, with the TAA doing its job much more effectively at higher resolutions. This is unlike Ubisoft's recent AC games, which have a TAA solution that works effectively at both 1080p and 4k.

My advice to anyone with a 1080p monitor is to attempt some supersampling with Nvidia DSR, and tune it to find a good balance between performance and visuals. If you have an RTX card you can even turn on DLSS to get your performance back, and improve the visuals massively pretty much for free.

Here's the steps to do so:

1. Open Nvidia Control Panel, and under global settings enable 4.00x under ""DSR - Factors"", and set ""DSR - Smoothness"" to 0%. Hit apply then launch the game.
2. In Watch Dogs Legion, you'll now have 3840x2160 as a resolution option. Turn that on.
3. If you have an RTX card, turn on DLSS. Test out all of the options find the best balance between performance and visuals. If you don't have an RTX card, instead use the ""Temporal Upscaling"" slider to experiment with different render resolutions until you find the best visuals/performance balance.

I know this isn't the best solution, and won't help people who are struggling to even run the game to begin with. I will say though to test this out even if the game isn't running perfectly smoothly for you at 1080p. Reason being is that the performance issues in this game are mostly CPU bound, and thus not tied to the game's resolution anyway.",Text

The whole idea of picking recruits, helping them, and them joining your team is great. For example, if you need to get up high to a roof, grab a construction worker and fly up, or just have too many enemies? Grab a fighter or rioter and group up some people to fight them. Not just that but stealth isn't a cake walk anymore. its not a instant kill with melee, and to get a decent far range weapon, a certain character is required. Last but not least, the new fighting game mechanic is great fun. It is difficult but not in a sense that you can't overcome your enemy.

Then he goes and calls it shit, the thing is yes it is another ubi game to a degree. He also shats on the voice acting. He did barely anything in the open world. Yes the hacking is dubbed down in the world, (traffic lights, sewers, calling cops) but he doesn’t praise the new hacks at all like cloak, spider bot, shroud. Which are new cool things to watch dogs, so in that sense wdl has better gameplay hacks then open world hacks. He also doesn’t go to mention how the gun variety and feel is improved over the previous games, which yeah he hasn’t played the others but still. He also doesn’t praise the driving which baffled me the driving feels like fucking butter lmao. Also he doesn’t act like the recruit anyone is cool or relevant, which it is yeah it has bad lip sink and voice acting, but the traits are cool the deep profiler is also really cool.

I also feel like the mission structure is a bit stale in this. Missions feel very samey and due to the lack of a tight story, the missions feel even duller because of it. I felt no motivation or reason for some of the missions but maybe I'm just a more story driven player, a player that needs a solid narrative weaved in.

WD Legion is underwhelming. My personal take on the game.,12,jkt6s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkt6s1/wd_legion_is_underwhelming_my_personal_take_on/,7,1604076559.0,LarryMyster,"Hi,

Just a quick reminder this is just based off my 8 hours of the gameplay, but from a person who is a big Ubisoft player I wanted to touch up on my thoughts for the game.**Some Spoilers ahead!**

**Story**

So the story to me seems pretty out there in terms that it's spread out really far in this City. This definitely feels different in terms of gameplay because you are not just one Protagonist, but the Protagonist is DedSec and you only play as one of many operatives you recruit. It's really hard to invest in a single DedSec character because it doesn't hold a single amount of abilities you can build from ground up. Each person you recruit has a specific perk and ability. I find this kind-of lack luster in terms of Character development because I can't really decide a favorite to use. Some better than others but I feel as though I am missing out on caring for some of them. If they die I just easily replace them. The lack in characters and dialog is a bit off putting. Voice Actors for different characters is definitely a plus to make up for that but it doesn't shine as good as it should. Story is 2/5

**Gameplay**

The feeling of smashing and round house kicking people in the face feels great. However the overall walking or running around feels a bit arcadeish, real jank for lack of a better word. In terms of movement both character and vehicles I'd say it was a bit lazy in these parts. The many collections (especially the tech points) are arguably the most tedious thing in this game. To advance or even feel to make a difference depends heavily on collecting items and unlocking stuff for DedSec. Gameplay is 3/5

**World and Environment**

London England is a magnificent place. I really enjoy sight seeing this place because for one, it really does resemble London in a lot of ways. The buildings, bridges and historical areas really brings out the world being alive. AI in this game is a bit dumb though. Enemies are really stupid and don't really react to the player and traffic is  antonymous. Graphics are really good as well the dynamic weather reaction to cars and pedestrians. HDR10 works well here in the game. World and Environment is 4/5

**Sound and Dialog**

Sound is great, I really enjoy the choices of Music put into the game. Horns on Vehicles are strange, some of the horns for certain vehicles don't really add up. Gun fights and dynamic weather sounds are real spot on. Dialog makes each person unique with their own personality, however it feels like they are just reading from a script which comes off as less care for them and their character. Sound and Dialog 3/5

**Conclusion**

WD Legion was delayed a couple times so that they worked tirelessly to make sure the game was in great condition for the player. I think the game can be fun, but a lot of the elements before Legion seemed to have been stripped away which was vital for its charm and Identity. This feels more so like a spinoff that was a really great concept on paper but the Execution of it wasn't really up to snuff. That feeling of why we fell in love of the series has disappeared from this title. Most of the time I ask myself ""why I am doing this? How does this help the cause?"" It is but a revenge plot to me instead of just a resistance. 

I'll keep playing this game because it is WD and I love this series but I feel as though it is a bit underwhelming, the feeling from the last 2 WDs just seemed to have fade away. 

My final personal score is 3.5/5",Text

However, I'm very pleasantly surprised by how it functions and it's strengths and weaknesses.

When I play WD2, I usually 'finish' areas by remaining outside and using the drones/cameras heavily, this is the gameplay experience that I loved most (even in WD1 I would attempt to do as much as I can before stepping a foot in the premises, but it was much more limited). 

In WD3 I started playing that way, heavily relying on the spider-bot, and quickly recruiting a drone specialist that also has a handy flying drone. But when I recruited an Albion officer (very early on) I was just amazed by how enjoyable the Hitman like gameplay in Legion is!

Walking around a hostile area (without the ability to take cover), distracting enemies that are about to spot you with a quick hack, cloaking for a couple of seconds to bypass a heavily guarded entrance and taking out isolated enemies is just so graceful and satisfying - It really changes the pace of the gameplay.

I guess I'm kinda rambling. I just really like this hacking+hitmanlike combination.",Text

I would love this to be a feature in the game.,4,jkxob9,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkxob9/i_would_love_this_to_be_a_feature_in_the_game/,2,1604096597.0,Wookieewomble,"I love the idea of playing as everyone and recruiting people for the cause. 

But when I'm not playing as these skilled people, they are just walking around or sitting in the safe house. 

I would like to make them, well...more useful when not playing as them. 


Imagine a list. 

A list were you chose up to 5 people. 
And a call button in the radial menu. 

Some examples:

* Smugglers for weapon delivery.
* Drivers when you need to get out of a tough situation.
* Bodyguard if you need backup.
* Hitman for taking out targets ( like in Ghost recon, except you only get three targets) 
* Drug dealers for... Well, drugs.


You get what I mean. 

It would make them so much more relevant to the game.

And it would actuly make you experiment more during missions.


Also, I don't like the weapon restrictions at all.

It would be better to just make it so everyone can use every weapon available.

But...

Those with the weapon already equipped, class or just what their background is ( MI5, Veteran, Mercenary ) have more experience with them, so they are more proficient with its use, like accuracy and ammo management.


Also, can we have ""class"" specific repeatable missions? 

* Hitman, with targets to kill. 
* Drivers with people to drive. 
* Again...drug dealers for dealing drugs. 

The mission structures can be lazy, I don't care. 
I just know I want them. 

That is all.

I honestly am struggling to like Legions,0,jl1xv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl1xv6/i_honestly_am_struggling_to_like_legions/,0,1604110128.0,potatohead657,"I came with a very positive mindset. I am trying really hard to only focus on the positive but I can’t seem to like it. The story is so forgettable, even mid mission it fails to grab my attention that I end up skipping cutscenes. 

And the dialogue, oh lord the dialogue. The cheesiness is beyond measure. And people say WD2 was bad. Speaking of which, it somehow plays and handles imho better than WD3, even looks better tbh. 

Too unpolished and the characters are no way near likeable. Especially when they speak. Sounds like Power Rangers writers wrote the script; no one speaks like that. The tech and gimmicks in-game are too futuristic that they break logic and immersion and it’s just underwhelming.

I’m gonna keep pushing through it hopefully it gets better, but I’m no longer as optimistic that it would impress.
I’m apprehensive about their next titles, Valhalla and Fra Cry...

PS: if you’re looking for a very fun new game now, Teardown has released yesterday on Steam, it saddens me that I find myself switching to it and spending more time there than legions.",Text
Legion: Horrible voice acting!,0,jl637c,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl637c/legion_horrible_voice_acting/,8,1604123605.0,Nukeacitrus,"So I've played for about an hour, and I got two crew members so far, both female and both with horrible voices. The first one has a bit of a slavic accent, which is fine, I enjoy variety, but the voice lacks any kind of emotion or believability, sounding like she's nervously reading from a script whenever she speaks, the voice stilted and forced. I'm unsure of the second ones accent, but that voice also makes me cringe whenever I hear it, equally bad as the first one.

In conversations, they'll say things like ""I tracked someone and walked into a trash bin. Not very deadsec"" and the other one will go ""No, that was not good."", both sounding like they're aliens trying to mimic human speech. I can't understand how whoever gave them directions passed this and thought these takes were good. I'd hate to hear how the rejected ones sounds!

To be clear, I'm not mad at them having accents, this isn't about them not sounding ""British"", but they just sound so uninvested and dull whenver they open their mouths.  I guess I could get used to it, and I'm aware that some people actually sounds like that IRL, but man... It's horrible. Hopefully I just got unlucky.  


EDIT: So I've been told that they used a AI to tune the voices to make them sound unique. Guess I really did get unlucky! I know two members who'll be going into some dangerous missions soon enough....",Text

Oversold and Under-Delivered,5,jkvi8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkvi8d/oversold_and_underdelivered/,9,1604088357.0,icGutta,"I’d like to start by saying that this in no way is a hate post. There’s isn’t much to hate with Watch Dogs Legion. But, with that being said... there aren’t many things to love either. 

WD Legion is very underwhelming imo. Starting with the many missing features that were prevalent in both of the previous games. Eavesdropping on phone calls, spying on texts, traffic cam hacks, emps. Hell, I could even say I miss the way Marcus would flip periodically while free running in WD2. I could go on but why bother.. majority of the cool stuff i enjoyed from the past is just gone.

The lack of a main protagonist leaves me feeling like I’m actually taking orders from a computer and not playing as someone whom is taking orders from a computer. It feels like I’m just here checking tasks off a list. Don’t get me wrong, swapping from character to character is a cool feature and I know we were told we could recruit and play as any NPC. However, what we weren’t told was that meant not being able to upgrade our favorites and unlock additional abilities to bolster whatever they started with. That, in combination with the fact that every character is so limited it almost forces you to swap between characters if you want to experience a different style of play and that is killing the immersion for me. I’ve had 4 of my favorite operatives die so far and can say I just didn’t care after the first because I can find some guy on the street with the same abilities. The sheer lack of investment i have in the characters takes away a major piece of what this game could have been imo. I feel as though this game should have had a primary protagonist and the recruiting should have been an addition to his or her’s story. As it is there just isn’t any depth to any of the playable characters or any backstory behind any of them in my legion aside from the script on their resume.

I had high hopes but so far I am a little disappointed in this game. It just doesn’t feel like a finished product.",Text

I am aware that during some main missions, if you arrive at a timed location you can in fact click a button prompt to wait until the required time. However, there doesn't seem to be any way of doing this under other circumstances (e.g. Deep Profiler clues) - am I missing something?

-London. That is all.

-boroughs, and the repetitive activities required to unlock each one
-all the characters seem more cartoony and wacky than past games (almost saints row: legions at this point)
-way less weapons than previous games

I came into this with such hype, I live in the UK, I love the first two games, open world and stealth! But man its just so Barry average. And mentioning the voice acting is just beating a dead horse at this point.

Update Edit: THE HACKER HAS BEEN LOCATED. The credit all belongs to u/tellmeabouthebow. I have confirmed a hacker spawn in Chinatown.

Not only that but this location is also a reliable spawn for a hypnotist. I can also confirm that fast traveling to a new location then back again will respawn everyone in this area, including the hypnotist. I didn't like the first one I found a fat lady with an atrocious accent. So I fast traveled, closed to the main menu, and fast traveled back.

But this npc system  
oh fuck me.  
Playing as anyone is cool, and this special set of perks is also cool, but for ppl like me that like to customize their characters, BOTH ways-: looks and playstyle.  Its the worst.   
I want to have good loking character. okay i got it but i got shitty perks Boom i found good perks character but it looks like shit. ey i found one with both damn but its voise sounds like fuckin rubber duck downpitched and reverbed. Even when i found character with all what i want. I CANT EVEN SWAP THIS SHITTY TAEASER GUNS FOR NORMAL ONES XDDD  
Seriously they do nothing, and thats the biggest pain in the ass for me in this game. That you cant play like you want, you are grounded by having to play stupid RNG game with your MAIN character/characters. I want to have silenced pistolk that can kill like in first game but also want some perks for hack, and EVEN when i will find character with all this it will be probably looking or sounding like garbage. I want to play this game so much but i dont enjoy it more than 50% i guess. I hope they gonna change it at least a little in the future.

Something feels off.,75,jkfla4,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkfla4/something_feels_off/,96,1604024714.0,zaxwlyde,"EDIT: I elaborated more in the comments on a reply, so I will post those points at the bottom of this edit. 

Full disclosure: I am an absolute mega-fan of the Watch_Dogs series. When the first one caught a ton of flack I viciously defended it even amidst the true flaws it had, and I absolutely adored the second to bits. I've platinumed both titles and waited eagerly for Legion, diving in the moment that it arrived.

My issues with Legion do not in any way shape or form focus on the current state of the PC performance (I previously play WD1+2 on PS4 but am now on PC). The issues that I have stem from the fact something just feels... off. It feels incredibly oversimplified in a sense, like how Skyrim was to Oblivion. It feels like a portion of the hacking components were stripped clean and the challenge removed from them. 

They also removed traffic-light manipulation which was something I loved to dick around with, and on top of it... It just feels, floaty I guess? While I think the combat was improved for gunplay, I feel like everything else was somewhat stripped back from the refinement of Watch_Dogs 2. I knew Legion would be divisive based on the lack of a proper character-centric story with the way the recruitment system worked, but I feel that it's far more than just the story that we lost in the process of this title.

I'm still going to stick by playing it in an effort to get through the story that's there and because I genuinely adore the franchise, but I'll admit I'm somewhat disappointed in what we got.

POINTS I ADDED:

- Point acknowledged for traffic-lights, still stands as the removal of a feature that many people enjoyed.
- The entire game feels floaty. The weight of movement feels decreased and there is a quality degradation to free-running, especially in regards to individual animation and character rigging.
- The Tech Tree was over-simplified and to be honest feels like they stripped away most of the really cool tech elements to direct too much focus onto drone technology.
- >!The story feels jagged and out of place in multiple parts. For example, the opening was incredibly cinematic and felt absolutely brilliant, right after it you're suddenly thrust into this random character in London with little to no initial backstory outside of Zero-Day hurting DedSec and you need to find this base. This guy just suddenly after 6 months ups and joins DedSec at random with almost no subcontext.!<
- Driving feels way more chaotically floaty. It feels way too easy to control vehicles now, as if they're made of jelly practically. There's no weight to it, and in my opinion it ruined motorcycles in the game for me.
- They simplified the difficulty by making it far easier than before to hack cameras and gain viewpoints into other rooms.
- Degradation in AI quality, more times than not the AI can see me yet not trip their alarms, making stealth piss-easy with little to no challenge to it.",Text

Suggestion: Further Customization,1,jl0jp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jl0jp5/suggestion_further_customization/,1,1604105792.0,Horizone102,"Listed below are some of the areas I think are really worth looking into for more customization in the game for our operatives. 

Granted, I don't think having total control over customization would work because then it kind of defeats the purpose of the recruiting system.

- Hair. Nothing is worse having some of these goons look ridiculous and not being able to do anything about it. 

- Lock in outfits so that your operatives will be wearing the clothing you've picked out for them specifically so they can show up in the game world/cutscenes as you want them.

- Additional perks that are one-offs for a character when using them. These can range from being able to purchase their own fire arm to things like buying their own vehicle. Instead of being able to grant them to everyone and forcing the player to choose on a case by case basis, this would prevent operatives from essentially all being the same with these one-off perks.

- Face and voice sets. This might be pushing it but sometimes these voices don't match the characters face. At the least being able to change the face would make it far easier in customizing a character to your liking. So they won't break immersion when my stone cold killer starts talking like they just won the lottery with their oddly chipper demeanor. 

Just suggestions I'd like to see.
I'm sure some will disagree but these are just my own little pet peeves. Regardless, I'm having fun with the game and greatly enjoy the hunting for operatives that fit my tastes. Usually.. lol",Text

Setting it HIGHER (50+, got mine at 75) actually does the opposite to what it says lmao. It decreases the Deadzone, giving the stick input more room to breathe and letting you make small adjustments easier.

As someone who struggles to consume media of any type without subtitles, going through the setting in Legion made me so excited and happy. Accessibility options often go overlooked past the usual “basic subtitle” toggle option. But having so many options for subtitles, color blind settings, audio transcription, aim-lock and sensitivity settings, simplified puzzles makes the game a lot more enjoyable for neuro-divergent people and people with disabilities and even people who may not be either of those.

I'm playing it on a pc. I was worried because I read many posting about crashing, but surprisingly I haven't experienced any bugs or lagging issues although my pc is not that great.

I usually hate driving in games. I'm really bad at controlling vehicles in games like GTA, but I liked this one. It didn't feel like I'm sliding on an icy road. It felt solid and was easy to make turns. Plus, the auto-driving option was a nice touch.

I decided to take time with this game rather than rushing the main campaign since CP got delayed again. I've been walking around visiting different stores and taking screenshots. London looked realistic and beautiful and I liked the variety of the clothing options I saw so far. I had so much fun just browsing clothing catalogs and customizing my recruits. lol.

One thing that I noticed was when I collect a new audio file, I have to go to the Data tab if I want to listen. The audio files that I found were interesting and I would like to listen, but I don't want to constantly pause the game. I wish they just automatically play when I collect them or have some sort of radio option for it.  Well, I don't know whether there is a background audio option for it or not, if there is please let me know.

Now this will all be a minor complaint if I can at some point unlock a more subdued lowkey headgear/mask like Aiden and Marcus have in the previous games..just give me a plain cloth face mask to pull up and we will be golden.

\-Story: Initially, the story started strong, then it hit a nose dive and the first few missions were really boring, till we got introduced to Kelly, 404 and soon Nigel Cass, It Started picking up by the 3rd hour and hope the pace is the same.

&#x200B;

\-Gameplay: Gunplay is something i wanna discuss, while it feels just fine, it felt better back in WD\_2, however I realized that there are settings that could be adjusted, if anyone knows settings to make gunplay feel more like WD\_2 (PS4) - please do tell. Stealth feels fun, takedowns are brutal and gadgets are cool, looking forward to play more. Driving is my least favorite, it was better in the previous 2 games, it felt way too easy to turn corners here, no sense of drift or weight, but it’s not a major complaint. 

\-Finally, play as anyone is quite Impressive, I’ve seen some creative missions in there, it’s a solid system, regarding the facial animations I guess it’s a must trade off when you can play as millions. facial animations in Story Cutscenes look remarkably better.

&#x200B;

Overall legion is fun, i really hope the story continues at a faster pace & ill Enjoy it",Text

I recognized her voice immediately, Sabine's VA is Olivia Morgan who played Mary Read (aka James Kidd) in Assassins Creed Black Flag. She was wonderful as Mary and it was a pleasant surprise to hear her as Sabine when I started the game today. James Kidd/Mary Read is one of the few AC side characters that stuck with me. 

I hope there is more to Sabine after the first few chaptets than just a sort of Dedsec mentor through your story.

Let's see if they do an actual character arc with her as Olivia Morgan certainly has the talent to pull off a good performance even with sometimes sub par Ubisoft writing.",Text

Any standard game owners get a message off Xbox about the season pass?,4,jkkvwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkkvwy/any_standard_game_owners_get_a_message_off_xbox/,5,1604041132.0,BaconStatham3,I just got a message saying ''Thanks for purchasing WDL. Your order comes with a season pass including content to be delivered at a later date''. The wording of it has thrown me off. It makes it sound like I have the pass even though I only bought the normal version. When I look on the store it says I have to buy it. Very strange.,Text

Anyone else finding Legion incredibly Boring,7,jkfi1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkfi1l/anyone_else_finding_legion_incredibly_boring/,17,1604024453.0,MiddleGuilty,"Pretty self-explanatory. The story is very shallow, the gameplay is absurdly repetitive and because of the NPC gimmick, they've made a game where I have no interest or connection to the story or the character I'm playing. Also, I've crashed 3 times in 3 hours. Feel like I've wasted my money as after 3 hours I've lost all interest and already know what the entirety of the game is gonna be like.

Stratsgy for searching for hitmen w/ silenced 9mm,2,jkmw38,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/jkmw38/stratsgy_for_searching_for_hitmen_w_silenced_9mm/,2,1604048004.0,LadulianIsle,"I've literally been combing the streets for hitmen, but I can't seem to find one with the stats I want.

Basically, add Transients, Smugglers, etc to the team page, then check with the in depth scan if they know a hitman, then check the hitman for a rival or something to get more rolls. (And then slowly remove the people that I added to the team, but don't actually want on the team one by one.)

I wish Ubisoft could add in depth scanning to a list of actions I can take without adding to my team, or another list.

I was wondering if there's a better way to try and get a better hitman. (Amateur Hitman, to be precise.)",Text

Let's say if I plan to stick to the start out guy for the whole game, does this mean missions will eventually get much harder later becuz the guy just has the one attribute from the beginning? Or maybe I'm missing something here...",Text
